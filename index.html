							<p><span class="first-leeter-big">When</span> Shane asked me to meet, I did a little background research
							on him first. I wondered what I—a mainstream heart surgeon—would possibly have to talk about with a “rogue chemist” who
							quit his great job at one of the most prestigious drug companies, Eli
							Lilly? Coincidentally, that’s the same drug company that gave me my
							first “bribe.” (Er, I mean, gift.) It was a black doctor’s bag with my name
							embossed in gold letters on the front. It took me awhile to see how I
							was being enticed to push meds . . . I still have it today.</p>
							<p>We met over lunch at Whole Foods. Like Shane, I too studied
							chemistry in college, so we shared the same educational background. In time, I received my surgical training in Cardiovascular
							and Thoracic Surgery from Yale University. Since then, I’ve performed over 5,000 open heart surgeries. I’m also honored to say I
							was inducted into The Beating Heart Hall of Fame. As we talked, I
							found Shane engaging and brilliant. I also learned that we had more
							in common than I had originally thought.</p>

								<p>I quickly learned that Shane’s journey was similar to mine. After
								performing thousands of coronary bypass operations, I finally came to
								understand that cholesterol lowering meds, diabetes drugs and low fat
								diets were harming my patients. I watched as countless heart attack
								victims lost their health to the misguided war on cholesterol and the
								use of prescription meds. When I spoke out to help my patients, I was
								scorned, labeled a quack and my career slandered in the media!</p>

								<p>Regardless, I continued “confessing” what I had witnessed
								under the lights of my sterile operating room. I guided my patients
								toward better lifestyle habits and natural alternatives. Threatening
								my hospital’s revenue stream, the medical license I was no longer
								using was officially revoked. From that point forward, I—like
								Shane—remained determined to “help people ditch their meds.”
								</p>

								<p>In 3 Worst Meds, he explains the real cause of heart disease with
								100% accuracy. He shows us why cholesterol-lowering drugs are
								the biggest fraud in medical history and the vast harm they cause.
								But that’s just the start. He has ominous warnings about many other
								so-called “blockbuster drugs.”</p>

								<p>Death by medicine has risen precipitously, year after year. In
								2006 researchers found that prescribed medicine was the leading
								cause of death, more than cancer and heart disease. It’s just gotten
								worse since then!</p>

								<p>As the cover of this book indicates, we are dangerously hovering in “the red zone” for medication overdoses. Deaths are reaching
								65,000 per year—a number impossible for most people to fathom.
								Adverse drug reactions (ADEs) and accidental medicine deaths are
								adding to the death toll. Without a doubt, modern medicine has
								become the biggest threat to our longevity. You’re 9,000 times more
								likely to be killed by a doctor than a gun owner.</p>

								<p>Doctors seem to have forgotten the first axiom of medicine:
								“Above all do no harm.” If you’re one of the 70% of Americans taking at least one prescription drug, you may be at risk for becoming
								a victim of the 3 worst meds.</p>

								<p>Don’t count on Big Pharma, the Food and Drug Administration
								(FDA), or your doctor to save you. The market for medicine is
								immensely profitable, which makes the temptation for lying about
								results too great. This is seen in aggressive prescribing habits of doctors who push the 3 worst meds, as well as the erroneous papers
								published in medical journals making meds appear safe and effective. The world has been conned.</p>

								<p>A recent study showed that 90% of meds are prescribed for the
								wrong reason. Editors of the world’s most prestigious medical journals—<i>The Journal of the American Medical Association</i> and <i>New
								England Journal of Medicine</i>—have stated that most of the medical
								research published today simply can’t be trusted. Yet medication
								sales are skyrocketing to record highs, year after year.</p>

								<p>The <i>British Medical Journal</i> published that two thirds of medical
								research is now sponsored by the drug industry. Medical journals—
								the go-to source for doctors to receive their information—have
								become accomplices, camouflaging the risks of top meds and even
								hiding the deaths that occur during clinical trials! Where does that
								leave us as medical consumers?</p>

								<p>Life is billions of electro-chemical reactions in every single cell, brilliantly coordinated to form us into the physical beings that we are. One
								mishap and it’s over. Who better than a chemist to explain how things
								work underneath the surface? Shane’s intelligence, unique experience and
								ardent research allows him to separate the BS (bad science) or barnyard
								BS (i.e., the lies that Big Pharma tells us) from the truth, for our benefit.</p>

							<p><span class="first-leeter-big">F</span>or over 25 years, I’ve been studying chemistry and medicine.
							During that time, I’ve been astonished by the number of

								<p>24/7 about their lives, yet can’t be bothered to change a damn thing.
								(It’s easier to bitch on social media and distract oneself with selfies,
								politics, and entertainment.)</p>

								<p>My 11-year-old son, Blair, competed in a submission grappling
								jiu-jitsu tournament. After hitting a beautifully executed, double leg
								takedown in the first five seconds, he got caught in a guillotine
								choke. Amid hundreds of screaming parents, a tap out and quick
								loss looked imminent.</p>

								<p>The guillotine is one of the simplest and most cunning of all
								chokes in grappling. Your neck gets firmly locked, noose-tight, inside
								your opponent’s death grip. But if you can scrape up enough determination to keep trying, the guillotine has weaknesses to exploit.</p>

								<p>Big Pharma currently has millions of Americans trapped in a
								prescription drug “guillotine.” The industry knows most people will
								simply give up and “tap out” before they even come close to figuring shit out. Burdened by side effects from their current prescription
								drugs, most people will just take MORE meds to mask the negative
								outcomes, while enriching their pill masters’ pockets. It’s a neverending spiral—one in which health inevitably declines.</p>

								<p>But that doesn’t have to be your fate. You’re holding this book,
								which will open your eyes and inspire you to free yourself. I wrote 3
								Worst Meds to help people just like you escape from Big Pharma’s choke
								hold. Using it, you can ditch the deadly pills in orange bottles, save
								your precious money, and ultimately add quality years to your life.</p>

								<p>Sadly, over time, I’ve watched people die from things that could’ve
								been easily avoided by ditching their meds. Using natural medicine
								and adhering to healthy habits would have saved them . . . period.
								They refused to read a simple book that could have shown them the

								<p>If you take the time to educate yourself by reading 3 Worst Meds,
								you’ll see that poor health is reversible. Like a guillotine choke, bad
								health has weaknesses to exploit. Signs of ill health show themselves
								years before it’s “too late.” And you ALWAYS have a choice. You have
								the power to change your own health even in ways that might seem
								miraculous—by using science combined with natural medicine.</p>

								<p>You can change your fate long before your declining health becomes
								permanently “irreversible.” Unless you’re dead, keep fighting. Best of all,
								you don’t need a single medication to do it. That’s right—no thin piece
								of paper with sloppy handwriting to carry to your dutifully over-worked,
								stressed out pharmacist. No orange bottles stapled into a white paper
								bag. No side effects to endure. No co-pays. No meds, period.
								Imagine a life free from all that shit.</p>

								<p>Cinched up, Blair knew he was in deep water. His face turning
								fire engine red, he heard coaches hovering over the mat, yelling for
								his opponent to squeeze harder. Blair took one last breath to buy 30
								seconds of time. This was his last-ditch effort to figure something
								out. Although he was losing air, he refused to give up.</p>

								<p>He went into the “tripod” position. His hips stacked up high, his
								shoulder pressed the air out of his opponent, giving him a dose of
								his own medicine. Reaching behind his assailant’s neck, Blair
								stacked hard enough to break the grip.</p>

								<p>He was free! He could breathe. But he knew the fight had just
								begun, and his gas tank was on empty. Continuing to push on after

								When you do that, losing is only a temporary setback on the road
								to victory.</p>

								<p>Most people regard this kind of victory in defeat as impossible.
								They refuse to keep fighting. They refuse to find a better way. They
								associate themselves with permanent loss.</p>

								<p>I decided long ago never to waste a single second trying to help those
								people. Millions are genuinely searching for a way out, while leaving
								their excuses at the door—those are the people I’m here to serve.</p>

								<p>If you aren’t willing to read and fight to regain health and longevity,
								how is anyone supposed to help you? How will you know who to
								believe? How will you make life-changing decisions required for your
								own health and that of your family’s health?</p>

								<p>With little time left, Blair escaped. But ultimately, he didn’t get
								his hand raised in victory. That’s not what mattered. What mattered
								is that he walked away having learned a valuable life lesson—it’s
								better to try and lose, than to NOT try at all and tap out. Because
								when you give up, you neither win nor live.</p>

								<p>He’ll carry this wisdom into his adult years. In time, as his character develops, he’ll respect the daily effort required to never fear
								the fight. The meaning of sacrifice and the reason for it will always
								supersede mere winning and losing. That alone will prevent Blair
								from ever failing while insisting, “I’ve tried everything!”</p>

								<p>Honestly, if any of my kids ever told me they “tried everything,”
								they’d get a well-executed spanking. If I expect to raise kids who
								don’t whine, act-out, or become liberal government slaves waiting
								for the next medical, insurance or welfare program handout, then
								it’s mandatory that I enforce highly defined boundaries that teach

				<p>A single test can cost up to $5,000, which is far too costly for
				the average consumer to do on their own, especially when multiple
				products are involved.</p>

				<p>My state-of-the-art testing methods are the same ones I used as
				a bench chemist for Big Pharma as well as my own company, The
				People’s Chemist (www.ThePeoplesChemist.com). As part of my
				<i>Blue Diamond Series</i>, I’ve included all the test results free of charge

				of razor-sharp laboratory precision is glossed over or even left out
				by doctors and online vitamin hucksters!</p>

				<p>My methodology for testing purity and potency validates that
				each product is naturally sourced (botanical) and not made in a lab
				(synthetic), which causes undue side effects and detracts from
				health. I also carefully screen for impurities such as pesticides,
				heavy metals, preservatives, and microbes from viral or bacterial
				contamination. And finally, every product has been tested to ensure
				that it carries the active, medicinal ingredients—from nature—
				required for a measurable result! Who else can provide that deep
				level of verification that a supplement is of high quality?</p>

				<p>You can also rest assured that all of my suggestions are free of any
				financial ties. In other words, I don’t do affiliate marketing. Nobody can
				pay me to recommend a product. I either find it of quality, or I don’t.
				Each referral is based on availability, purity, effectiveness, and safety.
				And although I do sell similar products that are held to a very high purity and potency standard as well (www.thepeopleschemist.com), I realize my products are not always available or affordable, and have therefore left them out of my tirade against the 3 worst meds.</p>

					<h3>The Three Worst Meds</h3>
					<p>The hardest part about writing <i>3 Worst Meds</i> was choosing them.
					There are so many harmful meds on the market, it’s like trying to
					decide who’s worse—Hitler or Stalin?</p>

					<p>Birth control, antidepressants, chemotherapy drugs, antibiotics,
					stimulants for ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder),
					anti-anxiety meds, insulin, and pain meds dominate most people’s
					lives. Over 50% of the American population is medicated...almost
					to death. The accompanying weight gain, depression, loss of memory, butchered energy, decreased motivation, and dwindling zest for
					life are all explained by the use of today’s mandated addiction to
					meds. Despite mile-long lists of side effects and decades of failure,
					doctors continue to present their prescription drugs as scientifically proven “solutions” to imminent health problems.</p>

					<p>Painkillers are leading the charge in overdoses. Almost 200,000
					Americans have died from addiction and overdose (see cover graph).
					For almost 40 years, manufacturers have made false claims insisting
					that, “despite widespread use of narcotic drugs in hospitals, the development of addiction is rare in medical patients with no history of
					addiction.” Meanwhile, an estimated 65,000 patients per year will continue to lose their lives, and that estimate is climbing. In 2007,
					painkiller manufacturers pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges that
					they misled regulators, doctors, and patients about the risk of addiction
					associated with the meds. But this is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

					<p>Ultimately, the WORST meds are those that are prescribed for
					daily use, as if they were vitamins. These are:</p>
					<p>
					1. Blood pressure meds<br>
					2. Cholesterol-lowering drugs<br>
					3. Aspirin</p>

					<p>These 3 worst meds are pushed as daily requirements for healthy
					living—<span class="font-italic">that’s what sets them apart from other deadly medicines.</span>
					Meanwhile, the mortality figures among users of these meds keeps
					climbing.</p>

					<p>Of course, this book wouldn’t be complete without a discussion of
					vaccines. As a father of four, I can’t be silent or pretend to be blind to
					the risks of childhood shots and their blatantly false representations.</p>

					<p>Glossed over in the media as mandatory and well-researched,
					today’s vaccine science is being relayed to the laymen with fuzzy
					generalizations and a thin patina of goodness. When you look at it
					from the perspective of a chemist and a father, you find that most
					vaccine science is an intricate work of fiction infused with a myriad
					of falsehoods and even cover-ups. Therefore, I’ve included a bonus
					chapter separating fact from fiction. In doing so, I’ve outlined three
					reasons why my wife and I chose not to vaccinate our four children.</p>

					<p><i>3 Worst Meds</i> is your ultimate health solution delivered on a silver
					platter—a no-holds barred exposé that serves as a much-needed wakeup call. Offering safe alternatives and simple lifestyle habits that yield
					positive measurable results, this book is the springboard for a new way
					of life—a definitive guide to escaping Big Pharma’s guillotine.</p>

					<p>You’ll learn how to bulletproof your cardiovascular system,
					strengthen your heart, open your arteries from inflammation, beat
					malaria, defend against rogue blood clots, boost your child’s
					immune system, and so much more you won’t find anywhere on the
					Internet. Using this information, you can ditch the meds before they
					sabotage your memory, weight, health, and longevity</p>

				<p><span class="first-leeter-big">To</span>  understand my fury with the drug industry, it helps to know
				my background. I was formerly a pharmaceutical drug chemist

				and every American hooked on drugs, while at the same time bankrupting them. Who was behind this push? Big Pharma and the Food
				and Drug Administration (FDA). Fresh out of graduate school, I
				received a master’s degree and was awarded graduate student of the
				year. Then I scored a job with pharmaceutical titan, Eli Lily.<br>

					<p>underway, courtesy of Pharma and the FDA. But over time, my experience in the lab confirmed my suspicions as fact.</p>

					<p>My passion for drug design initially arose from the miracle of
					emergency medicine—which is, by far, one of humankind’s greatest
					scientific achievements. I’ll be the first to admit that.</p>

					<p>Sadly though, medicine is no longer reserved for emergency
					use. Instead, it’s being used in a deadly game of profiteering, thanks
					to a pharmaceutical sales army that pushes unproven, toxic meds
					for everyday use—as if they were vitamins. Herein lies a story of
					deceit and my abandonment of modern medicine.</p>
					<h3>My First Assignment: Design a Drug to Stop
					Hot Flashes and Cancer</h3>
					<p>I was employed to design a new generation of Hormone
					Replacement Therapy (HRT) drugs, a class of drugs that includes
					Premarin, tamoxifen and raloxifene. They’re erroneously prescribed
					to cool hot flashes among middle-aged women, as well as decrease
					the risk of cancer. This is when my doubts about modern medicine
					began sprouting up.</p>

					<p>Initially, HRT meds were thought to work by blocking estrogen
					receptors. The hypothesis was that HRT meds could successfully put
					an end to hot flashes and cancer. Sounded good, right? As time progressed, we learned these drugs did just the opposite—they <i>activated</i>
					estrogen receptors and boosted cancer growth.</p>

					<p><span class="font-italic">The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)</span> recognized this trend. In their article “Hormone Replacement Therapy in
					Relation to Breast Cancer,” published in 2002, they wrote, “Our
					data add to the growing body of evidence that recent long-term use of HRT is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer and that
					such use may be related particularly to lobular tumors.”<sup>(1)</sup>

				<p>My task was made clear: design HRT “knock-offs” that were
				effective without causing cancer. My attempt to design safer alternatives began with small alterations to the three-dimensional structure of tamoxifen. Pluck an atom here, add one there, and test it.
				Simple.</p>

				<p>It was an everyday grind, but each new molecule and atomic rearrangement brought new possibilities. During this process, one
				outcome remained the same: <i>no matter how the atoms were re-organized, they all caused cancer, just like their parent compound tamoxifen.</i> This is because all HRT drugs are inherently cancer-causing.</p>

				<p>After one year of trial and error, the project was ended. I naively assumed that tamoxifen would be yanked from the market. To
				my surprise, access to tamoxifen and other HRT meds not only
				remained readily available—these drugs started being heavily marketed on TV. “What the fuck?!” I thought. Despite its ability to
				inflame and ignite cancer, tamoxifen remained the gold standard in
				breast cancer treatment.</p>

				<p>That’s when I realized something was seriously wrong. How
				does a drug that CAUSES cancer get promoted as a “cure” for cancer? How is it allowed to remain on the market, let alone be pushed
				as the gold standard cure? The irony was bizarre. It was impossible
				to wrap my head around. The evidence of tamoxifen’s dangers was
				indisputable and heavily documented. The truth could have easily
				been proven in any experiment and in a court of law . . . so what
				the hell was going on?</p>

					<p>As a young chemist, I was determined to better understand the

					people worldwide? Like a terrorist evading airport security, that’s
					exactly what these meds are doing—bypassing everyone’s radar.
					Thus began a lengthy process of pulling back the pharmaceutical
					curtain.<br>
					After a little digging, I discovered that “checkbook science,”
					medical ghostwriting, and drug lobbying made up the Holy Trinity
					for drug approval and sales. Science was dead. Ethics were tossed
					out the window. The drug approval process itself was rigged by an

					Massive institutional corruption had seeped into the very fibers of
					the entire “healthcare system” (more accurately known as “sick
					care”). This corruption led to a slew of dangerous drugs being
					unleashed on the public, in the open market—with no one being
					held accountable.<br>

					Digging through piles of research papers and government documents made available by The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA),
					I learned that each and every risky medication is approved with the
					government’s blessing. In fact, drug funding is siphoned directly
					from taxpayers (and insurance companies) to Big Pharma, courtesy
					of huge prescription med payouts made legal by The Bayh-Dole act.
					This made the tobacco industry look like saints.<br>

					In other words, the government was funding the very industry
					it was supposed to regulate. Meanwhile, drug companies paid that
					money right back to the government, in the form of lobbying and</p>

					cancer from tamoxifen or any other drug or vaccine, nobody in the
					drug industry will be held responsible. People will die and the

					<h3>Checkbook Science: Paying for a Blockbuster Drug</h3>

					<p>Tamoxifen was originally developed in 1967 by British company
					Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI). Their pharmaceutical division
					was later spun off as AstraZeneca. Knowing that consumer demand
					drives drug approval, they—in partnership with the American
					Cancer Society—established “National Breast Cancer Awareness
					Month.” This slick marketing campaign raised the fear level among
					women, which in turn raised the demand for tamoxifen.<br>

					Women worldwide began pushing for more choices in cancer
					drugs. Like puppets being manipulated on a string, they begged for
					the very drugs that would end up killing them. In Big Pharma language, that meant more drug approvals at a quicker rate. Artificial
					demand for tamoxifen had been successfully fabricated. Created out
					of thin air under the guise of “cancer awareness,” this demand would
					later fuel big drug sales. Each and every year, this conditioned response among the public is reactivated, thanks to the self-serving
					pink ribbon campaigns. (When you see a pink ribbon “compassionately” posted on Facebook, you’re seeing manipulation and greed.)</p>

				<p>Unable to ignore the public outcry, the FDA found themselves

				Just like chemists can manipulate the properties of matter at

				gross conflict of interest that goes unnoticed today.

				In order to hide the cancer-causing nature of tamoxifen, the

				tamoxifen! <sup>(3)</sup><br>

					make tamoxifen appear safe and effective, Fisher failed to report falsified data and enrollment fraud. His actions cast an even worse
					stench over the study, resulting in his eventual termination as director. The smoke and mirrors of checkbook science made it appear
					that tamoxifen reduced breast cancer by 50%. In reality, it was an
					insignificant 1.3% absolute difference, which wasn’t good enough
					for FDA approval. Meanwhile, independent studies showed that

					<li>Dr. Stephen I. Katz, director of the NIH’s National

					<li>From 1997-2002, Dr. John I. Gallin, director of the
					NIH’s Clinical Center, received between $145,000 and
					$322,000 in fees and stock proceeds from the drug
					industry.</li>

					<li>Dr. Richard C. Eastman is the NIH’s top diabetes
					researcher. As a consultant to the drug manufacturers in
					1997, he wrote to the Food and Drug Administration
					(FDA) defending a product without disclosing his conflict of interest. His letter stated that the risk of liver failure from the given drug was “very minimal.” Six months
					later, a patient taking the drug in an NIH study that
					Eastman oversaw, Audrey LaRue Jones, suffered sudden
					liver failure and died. An autopsy, along with liver
					experts, found that the drug had caused the liver failure.</li>

					<li>Dr. Ronald N. Germain, deputy director of a major laboratory at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious

when it comes to disclosing financial conflicts of interest, the NIH
is the most secretive agency in the U.S. government.<br>

True science has been abandoned. Because of this, whenever
you hear doctors regurgitate “result studies from peer reviewed
papers,” you can be damn sure it’s checkbook science at work, not
real science.<br>

Once artificial demand was created using emotion-stirring pink
ribbons, checkbook science painted the illusion that tamoxifen was
safe and effective. Now the FDA just needed one study to approve
the drug. They did that in record time—30 days flat! In fact,
AstraZeneca hired advisors within Big Pharma to sit on the FDA
review committee! Reviewing only 10% of the provided research,
the committee, of course, gave tamoxifen the green light as a preventive cancer treatment for healthy women.<br>

Aiming for wealth, not health, Big Pharma hit the financial bull’s
eye. Looked upon as the most effective treatment for breast cancer

became known in our lab.</p>

<p>Today doctors know very little, if anything, about how tamoxifen actually works in the body—or that it even causes cancer at all.
That’s because all of these facts have been buried by an avalanche of
ghostwritten articles. Medical ghostwriters are genius at positioning
tamoxifen as a novel anti-cancer drug, aromatase inhibitor, or whatever fancy concept the drug industry wants to sell it as!</p>

<h3>Medical Ghostwriting: A Profession That’s Paid to Lie</h3>

<p>If you dare to question your doctor about the prescriptions he doles
out to you, he’ll most likely cite a bunch of medical journals as “references” to substantiate his over-the-moon claims of safety and efficacy.
No doubt, whatever alleged piece of scientific writing he mentions will
be dripping with the drug’s so-called “benefits” and completely void of
its reported side effects. These falsified studies are nothing more than
expensive propaganda neatly crafted by ghostwriters and paid for by
the same companies who make the medication.<br>

A ghostwriter is someone who gets paid to be a drug industry
cheerleader. They’re paid to produce well-articulated, pseudoscientific writing. Once the final version is edited by Big Pharma, a top
physician (opinion leader) signs off as author, even though that doctor never researched the topic or placed a finger on the keyboard.
For their signature, they can fetch up to $30,000.<br>

Polished and spit-shined, the completed paper is published in
prestigious medical journals like <i>The New England Journal of
Medicine or The Journal of the American Medical Association.</i> These
writings are then used to sway doctors and the media into prescribing the industry’s driblets of poison. Non-industry, unbiased published work—which does exist when you dig for it as I’ve done for</p>

<p><i>3 Worst Meds</i>—is largely buried or forgotten. That’s how tamoxifen
slipped into the market. Ghostwriters hailed it as being wildly effective at preventing breast cancer. And doctors took the bait.
<br>
Meanwhile, independent studies—using real science, real data,
and no conflicts of interest—have shown the opposite of what medical ghostwriting shows. A few people have spoken out.
<br>
David Roe, a former staff attorney with the Environmental
Defense Fund and one of the authors of Proposition 65, intended to
show Californians how to make informed decisions about protecting themselves from chemicals known to cause cancer, birth defects,
or other reproductive harm. He insisted that tamoxifen be placed on
the list of proven carcinogens for the state of California.
<br>
Citing independent studies from around the world, Roe showed
a sixfold increase in uterine cancer among women treated with
tamoxifen. This prompted the drug manufacturer to list a warning
in the package insert that read, “An increased incidence . . . of
endometrial cancer has been reported in association with Nolvadex
treatment.” The chairman of the state’s scientific committee, epidemiologist Thomas Mack of USC, came forward to attest that the
number of uterine or endometrial cancers caused by tamoxifen “is
about as solid as it can get in humans.” Regardless, the drug
remained in the pharmacy as the go-to anticancer treatment for
women worldwide.<sup>(7)</sup>
<br>
We have ghostwriting to thank for covering up this critical evidence. Ghostwriters always achieve the same outcome: make a drug
look better than it is, so that doctors prescribe it, and patients receive
bad drugs disguised as good medicine. This system allows individual writers to hide by staying anonymous, while forgoing any shred
of responsibility for their actions. The result is massive carnage like</p>

which was hailed as “the safest painkiller,” according to ghostwritten
articles.<sup>(8)</sup> History is repeating itself today with opiates.
<br>
As deplorable as medical ghost authoring is, it’s more common
than you might think. It’s part of the many insidious practices that
make possible today’s mass poisoning via prescription drugs. Dr.
Jeffrey Drazen, editor for <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i>, insisted that he couldn’t find a single drug review author who didn’t have
obvious financial ties to drug companies. Dr. Richard Smith, editor
of <i>The British Journal of Medicine admitted that,</i> “We are being hoodwinked by the drug companies. The articles come in with doctors’
names on them and we often find some of them have little or no
idea about what they have written.<sup>”(9)</sup><br>

Are people seriously that desperate for a paycheck? You bet your
ass they are. Ultimately, ghostwriting does more than just sell drugs.
It’s a tool used by scientists, doctors, and politicians to sell the myth
of Western Medicine. If we actually paid doctors based on how
healthy their patients are, all of them would be out of a job.
Ghostwriting is the supreme manipulator, constantly working to
coax the American public into swallowing meds—as if prescription
drugs descended from the heavens for those lucky few who can
afford them, courtesy of their insurance policy.<br>

Dr. Leemon McHenry, a prominent PhD and professor of 30
years, told me in an interview, “Doctors who sign on these ghostwritten articles are guilty of fraud, of corrupting science and polluting the scientific record with misreporting of data.”</p>

<h3>The Emperor Has No Clothes</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, despite the outcry from a few informed individuals,
ghostwriting is still working. It’s fooling nearly everyone.
Consuming 50% of the world’s total supply of prescription drugs,
Americans form lines at the pharmacy like red ants at a picnic table.
Without question, they “ask their doctor if the latest drug is right
for them.” This canned script is encouraged more than thinking for
oneself. Newly devised screening programs for prostate cancer,
“pre-diabetes,” and <i>breast cancer</i> are all designed to encourage
patients to ask this unintelligent question—“Is this drug right for
me?” By design, the question is flawed. It’s meant to lead to one
obvious outcome—to get as many people as possible medicated - a
term known to drug industry insiders as disease inflation. (It’s the
art of making people fearful of disease—invented illness or otherwise—so they can sell more meds.)
<br>
The fact that so many people are fooled is reflective of the childhood tale, “The Emperor Has No Clothes.” In that story, two sneaky
weavers promised the emperor a new set of clothes. They handed
him an “invisible” gown, which he put on without question. People
gathered around town, whispering and smirking at an obviously
naked emperor who acted as though he was clothed. Nobody dared
to speak up. Due to embarrassment—and not wanting to offend the
emperor or lose their jobs—the adults stayed silent. Everybody was
afraid of looking dumb, save for a loud-mouthed child who had no
filter. They called out the obvious: “He’s not wearing anything!”
<br>
Meanwhile, the drug industry is naked. Here’s the truth: you
have more control over your health than you realize. Simple healthy
habits can erase virtually all symptoms of poor health. Your body
is the best healer.</p>

<p>Regardless, most doctors default to taking the easy route - meds.
They chirp, “The benefits outweigh the risks.” We’ve been hearing
this warble as far back as the 1950’s, even as the so-called “wonderdrug” thalidomide was robbing children of their appendages.<br>
Today, ghostwriting has successfully:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hooked children under 2 years of age on psychiatric meds</li>
<li>Made grown men fear cholesterol</li>
<li>Produced massive opiate addiction and deaths</li>
<li>Shoved blood pressure pills down the throats of anyone over 30 years old</li>
<li>Turned teens into doctor-approved meth-heads via ADHD meds</li>
<li>Drugged our teen girls with cancer-causing birth control pills</li>
<li>Increased women’s use of psychoactive drugs—even during pregnancy</li>
</ul>
<p>This shit has got to stop. As a chemist seeing the disparity
between medical fact and fiction among doctors, I had to talk with
an actual ghostwriter. That’s when I found Dr. Linda Logdberg.
<br>
A former ghostwriter, she has a bachelor’s degree from the University
of Michigan, an MA in psychology from UCLA, and an MSW from the
University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. She also has a PhD in neuroanatomy from UCLA. She has been a writer for more than 22 years
(formerly publishing research reports under the name “Linda A. Paul”).
<br>
She told me personally that a high salary, interesting work, convenience and flexibility, and a belief that she was helping sick people—were all compelling reasons for her to be a ghostwriter. Plus,
she had three children to take care of.</p>

<p>Eventually though, Linda began noticing the industry was
involved with a slew of dirty deals. After realizing her ghostwriting
was nothing more than “marketing masquerading as science” (her
words), she quit.
<br>
“Pharma is unworthy of trust: evidence from many sources
reveal these companies to be focused on the bottom line only,” she
told me. Citing “fraud in authorship,” she explained that “medical
researchers rarely informed the public on the pitfalls of drugs.
Instead, ghostwriters were crafting sales pitches for scientific publication and hired doctors moonlighting as the authors.”
<br>
Writing for the the <i>British Medical Journal</i>, Vera H. Sharav,
President of the Alliance for Human Research Protection (AHRP),
warned the scientific community, “Since the 1990s editors have
known (or should have) that [pharma] industry’s influence was
penetrating journals not only directly (through advertising) but
indirectly—by planting favorable reports often written by professional ghostwriters but ’authored’ by influential leaders in their
field. Academic scientists traded their influence for cash, penning
their names to biased, ghostwritten reports of trials they did not
conduct, and whose source data they did not analyze. Others, constrained by contractual publication restriction agreements with the
sponsoring company, published fraudulent reports based on partial
data findings. As two thirds of medical research is now sponsored
by industry, the most influential (“high impact”) medical journals
have become accomplices, camouflaging the commercial nature of
industry promotional reports.<sup>”(10)</sup>
<br>
Fortunately, a few leading medical journals are still publishing
valuable, independent work that questions the safety and efficacy of
modern medicine. It’s just a matter of knowing how to differentiate</p>

<p>fake ghostwritten work from genuine research. I’ve spelled out these
critical differences in <i>3 Worst Meds.</i> All references in this book are
verifiable. The published results have been duplicated independently by other scientists. If the validity of ghostwritten articles isn’t
thoroughly questioned, this form of fake communication will continue being used as the primary tool for swindling the public.
Meanwhile, ghostwriting will sway the U.S. government into
approving even more risky meds via drug lobbying. </p>
<h3>Drug Lobbying—The Revolving Door</h3>
<p><i>Lobbying (verb): To try to influence the thinking of legislators or other
public officials for or against a specific cause: lobbying for stronger
environmental safeguards; lobbied against the proliferation of
nuclear arm</i></p>
<p>I thought I was getting paid well as a new drug chemist. I was
driving a brand new PT Cruiser (my wife hated it), had $15,000 in
stock options, and was offered a $10,000 incentive to buy a new
house. Heck, if I was really good, I would get a $4,500 raise after a
year, which equated to a weekly burrito at Chipotle, with guacamole (which is extra), Mountain Dew included. I felt like I had
“made” it. But after taking a closer look at the real drug profits being
made, I realized I wasn’t even making pennies on the pharmaceutical dollar.
<br>
Obscene amounts of drug profits were going to the pharmaceutical titans, their shareholders, and even to the FDA. That’s right—
rather than being funded solely by taxpayers, our drug administration was (and still is) being paid by the very industry it’s supposed
to regulate. </p>

<p>This is legal, courtesy of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act
(PDUFA). Today the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research
(CDER) at the FDA is dependent on drug companies for nearly half
of its funding via the PDUFA. Prior to 1992 the government agency
was funded and beholden to taxpayers. Today, it gets its lion’s share
of profits directly from Big Pharma via reviews, thanks to the
PDUFA. That’s great for Big Pharma and bad for patients. This questionable stream of income is the glue that binds the FDA to its drug
lobbyists, while further influencing drug approval more than actual
science does.
<br>
Drug lobbying greases the “FDA revolving door” and blurs the
line between the drug industry and the U.S. government. If both
entities profit from the sales of drugs, then there’s simply no distinction between the two. One cannot be trusted to regulate the
other.
<br>
According to a report by the Center for Public Integrity, congressmen are outnumbered two to one by lobbyists for the pharmaceutical industry. Many are later put onto the government payroll
and vice versa. Total pharmaceutical lobbying in 2009 came to a
whopping $267,893,947. That’s enough money to feed 502 million
starving African children. Instead, it pays the drug approval
pipeline via 450 lobbying organizations, 1,743 lobbyists, and 1,113
revolvers (congress and senior congressional staffers who revolve in
and out of the private and public sectors). Quite frankly, this is what
kept tamoxifen on the market—drug lobbyists who profited from
tamoxifen sales convinced government officials to let the drug stay
there.<sup>(11)</sup></p>

		  <h3>One Nation Under Drugs</h3>
	<p>If stacked in cash, annual pharmaceutical profits would occupy two
	thousand stacks of bills. Each stack would be as high as the Empire
	State Building! You’d have more stacks of money than there are tall
	buildings in Los Angeles, and not enough people to guard them.</p>
	<p>
	Today global revenues from prescription drugs are nearing the trillion dollar mark, year after year. The US takes the largest bite out of the
	pharmaceutical pie, consuming $300.3 billion in prescriptions annually.</p>
	<p>
	With the collusion of the FDA, Big Pharma is now halfway to its
	goal of swindling the entire country into drug dependence. Today,
	America is a cult under the influence of Big Pharma, the U.S government, and Wall Street. We truly are “one nation under drugs.”</p>
	<p>
	For almost a hundred years, the masses have been exposed to
	pharmaceutically-funded mass education and TV without being
	taught a single shred of truth about preventive health and the risks
	of meds. Approximately 150 million Americans (just under half the
	country’s population) are now taking one or more prescription
	drugs per month, with 37% of those over 60 years old taking five
	or more! And nobody is healthy. Just look around.</p>
	<p>
	If John Galt—the noble fictional scientist in Ayn Rand’s novel,
	Atlas Shrugged—symbolizes the power and glory of the human
	mind, then FDA approval and Big Pharma are his biggest threats.
	Together, they’ve created a corporate drug leviathan that’s robbing
	every man, woman, and child in its path of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This profit-pulling monster has no checks or balances. This makes it almost impossible to fight and scary as hell to
	witness through the eyes of a chemist.</p>
	<p>If not checked, many physicians will become de facto pharmaceutical foot soldiers. Acting as the Praetorian guards of Big Pharma,</p>

<p>they’ll believe any propaganda served up from ghostwriting and
checkbook science. In the words of Voltaire, <span class="italic-font">“Those who can make
you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities.”</span></p>
<p>
This age-old wisdom confirms what I’ve written in this book.
Doctors are required to take an oath of, “First do no harm.” But if
they’re unaware of the influences driving the drug approval process
and corresponding drug sales, then their oath is meaningless. They
might as well be crossing their fingers behind their back, like children.
</p>
<p>
As a chemist for a drug company, I had to face the cold, hard
facts: Western Medicine has become a billion dollar empire not by
relying on keen science, but rather by using corruption and deceit.
The end result has been “One Nation Under Drugs” with slavery
and sickness for all. Nobody on meds is free. You can’t be healthy
and on meds at the same time. Period. This subjugation of the population has resulted in a standard of health in America whereby sick
care is disguised as “health care.”</p>
<p>Each year, prescription drugs (used as prescribed) kill an estimated 105,000 people—on top of another 65,000 overdose—more casualties than the Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq wars combined. This
blatant attack on human life happens thanks to voluntary compliance
or as I call it,<span class="italic-font"> willful ignorance</span>. Most of us want to blame Big Pharma,
doctors, and the government. But this blindness and myopic thinking
hides the real question: “Are we really any healthier by taking all these
meds?” For the sake of your own health (and life), it’s up to you to ask
this question—because clearly the “professionals” won’t bother.</p>
<p>
The answer to this question would shut down labs all across the
world. Wall Street would take a much-needed pay cut. The government would have to find new scams to generate money. The system
that aims to medicate us all to death would crumble overnight.

  <h3>F%@k This . . . I Quit</h3>
<p>Disgusted, I couldn’t allow myself to be an accomplice any longer.
Outside of an emergency, meds are the problem, not the solution.
The science proves it. This truth continues to be the driving motivation for all the work I do. I’d miss the lab, but not the lies.</p>
<p>
I gave my one-year notice, then spent the following year prepping for my departure. (I would have quit sooner—but if you quit
without notice, you lose your stock options, which I needed.) At the
time, my daughter Lily was a year old. I had an inflated car loan,
along with typical family bills. My bank balance showed $14,000
from the initial signing bonus I’d received as a young, motivated
chemist. Naively, I thought I had “plenty.”</p>
<p>
My first step was to shed the car payment. When I called the
repo guys to come get my PT Cruiser, my wife was ecstatic. (She
thought it was an extreme eye sore.) I replaced it with the smoothrunning engine of a 250cc Honda Skyhawk motorcycle. I got it for
$1,400. We were down to $12,600.</p>
<p>
For the next four months—November through February—I
rode that motorcycle to work, fulfilling my remaining duties at
work. It was a 25-minute commute one way. We lived in snowy
Denver, Colorado. The trickiest part was ignoring my urge to press
the breaks over the ice patches. (I always waved to the guys in their
warm SUVs looking at me in disbelief.) I needed a leather jacket and
a helmet. My balance quickly dwindled to $12,400.</p>
<p>
Planning a move to the same town where my wife and I had met,
I rented a moving truck and a new home in Durango, Colorado.
Barely moved in, our funds had sunk quickly. We were well below
the $10,000 mark.</p>

<p>Lea-Ann was getting nervous. She started cutting hair to keep us
afloat. For years, we shared a car, exercised with a medicine ball in
the garage (Google my “18 Minute Workout”), and got gas money
from her parents on a couple occasions while we visited.
Meanwhile, I started a blog (ThePeoplesChemist.com) where I
taught people how to ditch the meds. My brand became the antithesis of what people are normally told. Unfortunately for me, helping
people ditch their meds didn’t pay well. . .</p>
<p>
A few people started listening along the way. And then a few
more. Regrettably, I was up against a powerful monster. Checkbook
science, ghostwriting, and pharmaceutical lobbying had successfully
hooked most people on the 3 worst meds. I was determined to show
as many people as possible the truth, which you now hold in your
hands. Take it or leave it.</p>
<p>
This book is proof that my early suspicions as a bench chemist
for Pharma were true. An insidious and deliberate push to get each
and every American hooked on drugs, while at the same time
bankrupting them, does in fact exist. Today that push has grown
into a forceful shove that starts at birth with a barrage of vaccines.
From the time they squeeze out of the womb, infants are pummeled with shots, a sinister welcome gift into “One Nation Under
Drugs.” What happens in the hospital is a foreshadowing of what’s
to come in life.</p>
<p>
With the reckless voracity of a school of hungry pirañas in
bloodied water, Big Pharma parades the world behind a mask of
philanthropy and health. Meanwhile, it disregards science and the
precious lives of billions of people worldwide. Those controlling
this profit-driven, prescription drug conveyor belt should hold
some sort of record for having the most reckless disregard for</p>

<p>As his high blood pressure crept up, his doctor insisted he was
at greater risk for heart attack and stroke. In the same breath, he prescribed Thom blood pressure meds. (Keep in mind, Thom was only
42 years old at the time.) Trusting his doctor, he complied and dutifully began taking the meds. In time, his body began deteriorating</p>
<p>A competitor at 155 pounds, Thom was mortified as the scale
soon hit 205 pounds. While on meds, he became lethargic and
depressed. Grappling, exercise, sex, and essentially everything else
that’s important—all took a backseat to his new, doctor-mandated
drug use. Diet and exercise failed to help.</p>
<p>Thom’s entire well-being and identity were stolen—all because
of one fucking blood pressure pill. He had no idea that blood pressure meds (known as beta blockers) would slow his metabolism!
When swallowed, this weight-inflating class of meds works by
slowing the heart rate to elicit an artificially lower blood pressure
reading. The less pumping the heart does, the less pressure there is
. . . which also means less oxygen distribution and less nutrient distribution throughout the body. As the body gets starved of vital
nutrients, it goes into crisis mode and begins packing on the weight,
preparing for a famine. Doctors today somehow think this is
healthy</p>
<p>Simultaneously, beta blockers also throw hormones out of balance. Fat storage begins to take precedence over fat burning. No
matter how hard you try, you can’t lose weight while you’re on
blood pressure meds, due to this insidious blockade of metabolic
function.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Thom saved himself and ditched the meds. Thanks to
a naturopathic doctor, he learned the dangers of blood pressure pills
and trashed them. His weight rebounded and today he’s med-free.</p>

<p>Not everyone’s that lucky. For most people, taking blood pressure pills just leads to more pills. It causes a prescription drug landslide, where side effects show up—and they begin taking additional meds to offset the side effects of the original meds. And on and
on. This chemical assault to the body causes people to lose energy
and motivation. Their belly starts pushing bigger belt sizes and their
testosterone bottoms out like a sunken ship.</p>
<p>
In time, blood pressure meds cause Type II diabetes, heart disease,
then cancer, or all of the above. This is when doctors go completely
nuts and start prescribing even more meds—metformin, aspirin and
other blood thinners, and even the worst possible drug, insulin! It’s
like a merry-go-round, always getting a new drug when they return to
the doctor’s office with side effects from the previous prescription.
“The emperor has no clothes.” In other words, the “blockbuster”
meds being prescribed by the doctor aren’t working!</p>
<p>
In any other profession, this kind of “expert” would be fired or
jailed for doing such egregious harm to the client. Not in Western
Medicine. Doctors are rewarded for piling on more and more meds.
Meanwhile, patients die young, Big Pharma gets rich. Wall
Street wolfs buy more jets. The sales strategy is repeated.</p>
<p>
This tragedy is occurring in broad daylight, all over the country
. . . and nobody is doing shit about it. Why? Because this deadly
sales trajectory is funneling massive profits to Big Pharma and a portion us used to paint a benevolent portrait of Big Pharma in the
media worldwide.</p>

Americans should be on blood pressure meds. Paid experts are

In September of 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) announced that “Poor blood-pressure control
puts 5 million older Americans at risk.” In their pharmaceuticallyfunded propaganda piece, they insisted that millions of “Medicare
enrollees age 65 and older are not taking their blood pressure medicine properly, increasing their risk of heart disease, stroke, kidney
disease, and death.<sup>”(2)</sup></p>
<p>
This kind of marketing tripe is part of what allows the “mass
poisoning by meds” to occur legally, in broad daylight. But as you’ll
soon learn, this is just a slick ploy for scaring perfectly healthy people into taking meds. After all, the one suggestion made to correct
high blood pressure was to “take your blood pressure medicine as
prescribed,” said CDC Director Tom Frieden, MD, MPH. Could the
conflict of interest be any more obvious? Why not suggest healthy
lifestyle changes and proven natural alternatives?</p>
<p>
For most people, it’s time to get the hell off blood pressure
meds. Your doctor’s assurances that “you have a history of hypertension in your family” and “lower is better,” are nothing more than
contrived sales pitches for meds.</p>

verge of losing his pilot’s license due to poor health caused by prescription drugs. He wrote:</p>

“I am 58. About 5 years ago while getting my third class
medical, the examiner said my blood pressure was getting a little high and suggested I talk to my personal doctor about what
to do. So being a little naive and trusting, I went to the doctor
and was immediately prescribed meds with a follow-up in a
month. Still trusting, I went back and now was prescribed betablockers and statins for my high cholesterol.”</p>

<h3>What Should My Blood Pressure Be?</h3>
<p>
Simply being alive raises blood pressure (BP). You don’t necessarily
need medications to adjust it. Unfortunately though, far too many
people have been drugged by their doctors—or even dentists—to
curb the natural rise in blood pressure.</p>
<p>
This is a dangerous game of roulette. Understanding what a normal, healthy BP is will help you make better decisions about medications and their natural alternatives.</p>
<p>
Long-term blood pressure is controlled primarily by the kidneys
via a chemical cascade known as the renin-angiotensin system. This</p>

<p>was discovered in 1898 with studies made by scientists who found
that they could manipulate blood pressure with kidney extracts.<sup>(3)</sup></p>
<p>
Decades later, chemists from Eli Lilly in Indianapolis and the
Medical School of the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina, isolated the chief compound responsible for raising blood pressure. They
named it angiotensin. Today, this kidney specific molecule is the
primary target for many blood pressure controlling meds. Block it
and blood pressure will drop.</p>
<p>
The body has many incalculable feedback mechanisms that promote
the healthy rise and fall of blood pressure. Exercise, stress, passion,
excitement, obesity, smoking, and even the immune system can all cause
temporary spikes in blood pressure. Sometimes these are normal; sometimes they’re not so normal. The trick is deciding when to intervene.</p>
<p>
For example, various emotions of excitement and fear (perhaps
from sitting in a dental chair) can spur the arteries and veins to
expand and narrow. This can result in short-term spikes in blood
pressure. Anything that increases the heart rate, blood volume, or the
expanding and narrowing of arteries and veins can increase blood
pressure. Hell, even my swearing can raise your blood pressure.</p>
<p>
All too often though, the smallest jump in blood pressure
becomes the perfect excuse to hook patients on daily meds. This is
when it gets risky.</p>
<p>
During the first year of life, the average BP for an infant is 100/70.
The top number is known as systolic and represents the amount of
pressure placed on the arteries when the heart contracts. The bottom
number is known as diastolic and represents the pressure when the
heart relaxes.</p>
<p>
If you’re lucky enough to age, your BP will continue to rise. This
is a normal, healthy process. Remember that. In most cases of rising</p>

<p>blood pressure, there’s nothing to fear. It’s usually just a response to
the body’s increased need for oxygen, nutrients, or energy.</p>
<p>
For decades, Big Pharma has been making sweeping generalizations about blood pressure levels. They push everyone to drive their
blood pressure lower and lower, suggesting a uniform systolic (top
number) of 120. These guidelines of “lower is better” have been at
war with scientific evidence, which proves that “lower is not better”
as we age. In other words, high blood pressure—defined as anything over 140/80—is actually healthy as we age. It’s NOT a death
sentence! Evidence for this truth was uncovered over a century ago!</p>
<p>
In fact, it was first outlined in <i>Circulation of the Blood: Men And
Ideas</i>. Cardiovascular research pioneers Fred Akbar Mahomed,
Clifford Allbutt, and Henri Huchard demonstrated from 1874 to
1893 that hypertension (i.e., high blood pressure) may occur without overt renal disease and may even be present <i>before</i> hardening of
the arteries or blockage.<sup>(4)</sup></p>
<p>
Think about it. That means rising blood pressure is not a sign of
illness, whatsoever. These scientists coined the term “essential hypertension” to describe the elevation of blood pressure as a normal,
compensatory reaction to healthy aging. Ever since then, this same
research has been duplicated and observed by scientists . . . while
being entirely ignored by Big Pharma and the media.</p>
<p>
<p>  
In a 1912 speech to the Glasgow Southern Medical Society, Sir
William Osler made the following statement about high blood pressure being associated with atherosclerosis: “In this group of cases it is
well to recognize that the extra pressure is a necessity—as purely a
mechanical affair as in any great irrigation system with old encrusted
mains and weedy channels.<span class="italic-font"> Get it out of your heads, if possible, that the
high pressure is the primary feature, and particularly the feature to treat.”</span> </p>

<p>These early biological observations were the eventual basis for
scientists to discourage the development of blood pressure drugs. In
2016, <span class="italic-font">The British Medical Journal</span> published findings that confirmed
these early sentiments and warnings. Independent researchers in
Sweden conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses guided by
recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration. Comparing about
74,000 patients lowering their blood pressure with meds, they concluded, “This systematic review and meta-analyses confirms if systolic blood pressure is less than 140 mm Hg, we found no benefit,
but potential harm, with an increased risk of cardiovascular death.<sup>”(5)</sup></p>
<p>
The harm they reported came from prescription drug side
effects. This represents a classic story of the “cure” being worse than
the so-called disease. Not only did this put a spotlight on the dangers of meds, it also proved that essential hypertension (that which
is over 140 systolic) is not a valid reason for drug use—but rather,
an indication of healthy living as we age. The body is simply maximizing its ability to deliver more oxygen and nutrients as needed.</p>
<p>
Therefore, when so-called promoters of Western Medicine assert
that we ALL need to have blood pressure lower than 140/80, they’re
giving horrible advice that could kill you. It’s nothing more than a
sales ploy. As a former pharmaceutical chemist, I saw this message
being pushed far too many times. To further disprove the “lower is
better” dogma of the medical community, just look at lifespan among
those who adhere to it. If high blood pressure were truly dangerous,
then lowering it with hypertension drugs would increase longevity.
But the opposite is true as I showed in my book, <span class="italic-font">Over-The-Counter

cancer as a direct result of using drugs like beta blockers, ACEinhibitors and calcium channel blockers. Quality of life was eroded exponentially, despite the “doctor approved” lower-is-better
numbers.</p>
<p>
In an interview with <span class="italic-font">The New York Times,</span> Dr. Suzanne Oparil,
director of the Vascular Biology and Hypertension Program at the
University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine affirmed
the risk by saying, “Medications that lower blood pressure can have

pressure experts in the past has been that lower is better. Recent

<p>meds to lower blood pressure. In general, it’s completely natural for
the first number (systolic) to be 100 plus our age. Diastolic pressure
has shown no correlation to early death. But if it goes to 100, you
may or may not have poor kidney health. Otherwise, rising blood
pressure is simply essential hypertension. It’s the body’s way of
delivering more oxygen and nutrients. The exception to the rule
would be if you have rising blood pressure coupled to obesity, heart
disease or Type II diabetes.</p>
<p>
If you have any of these conditions, in addition to rising blood
pressure, then it’s no longer essential high hypertension. It’s a warning sign of poor health. At best, your unhealthy lifestyle habits are
eroding away your longevity and you need to make a change. At
worst, it could be a sign of coronary events, stroke, heart failure,
and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). That’s when your doctor will
start throwing a barrage of blood pressure meds at you such as beta
blockers, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. Before you
start following doctor’s orders, you had better know the risks of
each of these meds. (Just remember Thom the grappler and Roger
the pilot and how blood pressure meds butchered their health!)</p>

<h3>How Blood Pressure Meds Harm You</h3>

<p>Currently, three types of blood pressure meds are commonly prescribed—beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and ACE-inhibitors.
Although they all aim to achieve “better” (i.e., lower) BP numbers, each
one works in a different way. Understanding their “mechanism of
action” highlights their dangers and overt toxicity.</p>
<p>
Beta-blockers are the most common blood pressure meds. The
name refers to their ability to block a family of receptors in the body</p>

<div class="content-center">
<p>known as “beta-receptors.” They’re responsible for controlling heart
beat, fat metabolism, and energy.</p>
<p>
When activated, beta-receptors trigger increases in heart rate,
thanks to naturally produced compounds from the adrenal glands.
This ensures that your heart rate increases in response to activity.
But that’s not all. Flipped on, they also shuttle fat into your cells’
fuel furnace—the mitochondria—to create an abundance of energy.
Hence, beta-receptors are a primary activator of fat loss.</p>
<p>
If you cover up these life-activating receptors, you will also slow
heart rate, fat metabolism, and energy production. (Just like when
you take your foot off the gas, your car will eventually slow down.)
This is measured as a drop in blood pressure. But in time, this
receptor-shielding throws hormones out of whack. The body then
becomes ripe for cancer, heart disease, and Type II diabetes. Still, for
almost 50 years, doctors have been misinterpreting the unhealthy
drop in blood pressure as a “healthy” outcome!</p>
<p>
To avoid the side effects of beta-blockers, some doctors opt for
ACE-inhibitors. ACE-Inhibitor stands for angiotensin-converting
enzyme. Designed from snake venom, these drugs relax the arteries—but they do it so damn much that heart failure becomes a real
and present danger among users. <span class="italic-font">The Pharmaceutical Journal</span> warned
doctors, “While most hypertensive patients could cope with feeling
a little dizzy, the combination of low blood pressure, deteriorating
renal function and increased plasma potassium could result in
arrhythmias and deaths in heart failure patients.”</p>
<p>
And finally, there are calcium channel blockers. These block
electrical transmission in the heart, causing blood pressure to sink.
Absurd. Calcium is the chief substance required for igniting and
controlling heart health and the strength of contractions for distri</p>

death. If that’s not bad enough, this class of medications is also
notorious for causing cancer.</p>
<p>
In 2013,<span class="italic-font"> The Journal of the American Medical Association </span>(JAMA)
published a study from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center, theorizing that calcium channel blockers may cause breast
cancer. The study monitored more than 1,700 women between the
ages of 55 and 74. They were divided into three groups: a control
group that was cancer-free and two more groups that included
women who had either been diagnosed with invasive lobular cancer or invasive ductal breast cancer. Shockingly, women who were
on the meds for a period of 10 years increased their risk of developing lobular and ductal breast cancer by a whopping 2.5 times! <sup>(8)</sup></p>
<p>
Overall, scientific journals from around the world have shown
that people who take blood pressure meds are at a higher risk of
dying or being hospitalized for cardiac procedures, regardless of any
blood pressure lowering effects from the meds. Researchers from
The New York University School of Medicine monitored 44,000
people who were at risk for atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). They wrote that the most common, nasty side effects of popular heart medications were “fatigue, headache, upset stomach,
weight gain, Type II diabetes.”</p>
<p>
The research of both past and present continues to show a glaringly obvious truth—that blood pressure meds are the problem, not
the solution. Fortunately, there are wildly effective and safe natural
medicines available to us. We don’t have to resort to risky prescription drugs. All of the available natural cures can help you control
your blood pressure, optimize heart health, bust unruly blood clots,
and increase the distribution of oxygen and nutrients throughout</p>

your blood pressure meds. There’s a right and a wrong way to it.</p>

<h3>How to Safely Wean Off Blood Pressure Meds</h3>

<p>
If you’re currently taking prescription blood pressure drugs, don’t
stop cold turkey. Wean off them gradually. To begin, take the normal dose of your prescription every other day for two weeks, then
every third day for two more weeks. After four weeks, your body
should be completely weaned from the meds and you can safely
abstain. During this time, you can safely take the alternatives mentioned below, though you will want to abstain from rauwolfia until
fully weaned.

<h3>The Natural Alternatives Pharma Doesn’ tWant You to Know About</h3>
<p>
For a medicine to be truly effective, it can’t be more dangerous than
the illness it’s trying to treat. Duh. This simple approach to health
has been forgotten in favor of massive profits. Gone are the days of
“First do no harm.” The growing mortality rates from blood pressure meds prove it. </p>
<p>
Fortunately, and to the surprise of most, you can ditch all blood
pressure drugs and switch to Mother Nature’s healthier alternatives—which are very similar molecularly, but very safe!</p>

Natural compounds that treat blood pressure were discovered
by the same industry that conceals them. That’s because the design
of prescription drugs is guided by ethnobotany—the study of plants

Once the active, natural compound is characterized, the pharmaceutical industry rearranges a few atoms in hopes of preserving
the plant’s medicinal qualities in their own, newly-created drug.
This allows for patents and monopoly rights to be created, protecting the altered copycat. Unfortunately, once mixed up, the new
pharmaceutical creation comes with less efficacy and more side

The story of the malaria drug artemisinin (derived from naturally occurring wormwood) is one of the most compelling examples

treatments for malaria.</p>

Plasmodia, malaria leads to the destruction of oxygen-carrying red
blood cells and ultimately death. A massive threat to Mao’s military,
Plasmodia developed resistance to chloroquine and other antimalarial drugs being used at the time. In response, Mao recruited
600 scientists to overcome the scourge. The army of scientists used
two chief tactics: ethnobotany and organic chemistry. They discovered sweet wormwood as the definitive cure for malaria.</p>

<p>ods to confirm and identify sweet wormwood’s antimalarial properties more specifically.</p>
<p>
The primary active ingredients were obtained by cold water extraction (tea) and eventually named artemisinin. This “whole herb extract”
became one of the most successful treatments in history for malaria!
Further studies by Tu used ethyl ether extractions (a chemistry method
that isolates single compounds from whole botanical sources) to identify the most potent ingredient. In her Nobel Prize Biography she
wrote, “On October 4, 1971, we observed that sample number 191 of
the Qinghao (sweet wormwood) ethyl ether extract showed 100%
effectiveness in inhibiting malaria parasites in rodent malaria.”</p>
<p>
In 2015, Tu received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine
for her work. But her discovery of natural wormwood actives was
overshadowed by the pharmaceutical mimics of artemisinin, namely
dihydroartemisinin (a prescription copy-cat of sweet wormwood),
which was positioned as the anti-malaria blockbuster. Even today
though, this pharmaceutical, stripped-down version of wormwood
is proving worthless in the face of Plasmodia (which has begun
building drug resistance) . . . yet sweet wormwood tea remains the
true blockbuster, known as far back as when Mao ruled.<sup>(10,11,12)</sup></p>

<p>This reverse engineering of the elemental secrets of plants isn’t
new. It’s been going on since the first beaker was dropped on the
sterile laboratory floor of Big Pharma. Aspirin is a knockoff of white
willow bark. Pseudoephedrine was inspired by the use of ma huang
for asthma in Chinese medicine. Today’s painkillers morphine,
codeine, thebaine, and others are the bastard children of the much
safer and less addictive poppy plant; and many anticancer drugs
come from Madagascar periwinkle and other natural compounds as
outlined in <span class="italic-font">Over-The Counter Natural Cures Expanded.</span></p>
<p>
The drug industry tries to obfuscate the robbery. They want the
public and media to think they intuitively invent blockbuster medications out of thin air, and that drugs are the only option. Thanks
to widespread ignorance, this scheme cements the doctor-patientdrug-insurance charade in the minds of patients. It keeps people
forever drinking from the pharmaceutical trough, until their deaths.</p>
<p>
Natural medicine not only predates civilization—it’s older than
humanity itself. <span class="italic-font">The New York Times</span> reminded us that “many animals
self-medicate with plants: In Panama, members of the raccoon family
known as coatis rub minty tree resin through their fur to deter fleas,
ticks and lice, and some great apes and monkeys swallow mildly toxic
leaves seemingly to fight infestations of parasitic worms.”</p>
<p>
Hairless and still learning to use their opposable thumbs, our
ancestors were always on the hunt for plant-based medicines.
Modern day science has shown these work better than today’s pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>
Between 50 and 70 A.D., the Greek surgeon Dioscorides learned
how to make balms, elixirs, and anesthetics from hundreds of plants
such as peppermint, hemlock, and cannabis. He published his findings in a pharmacopoeia eventually known as <i>De Materia Medica</i>,</p>

This same tedious process of finding new medicines from nature
gave rise to three of the most effective natural products for creating
total cardiovascular health—hawthorn, cayenne, and rauwolfia. In
time though, all three of these were hidden and ultimately forbidden by the pharmaceutical business model, which prefers the
stripped-down, costly, and risky synthetic versions (because they
can patent those and make big profits). Fortunately, each and every
one of these natural cardiovascular cures is readily available.</p>
<p>
For moderate hypertension and prevention, hawthorn is usually the first choice. In addition to relaxing arteries to lower blood
pressure, it also strengthens the heart and dismembers unruly blood
clots on contact, without excessive bleeding. History has shown this
repeatedly.</p>
<p>
The successful use of hawthorn dates all the way back to the
17th century when it was popularized by French doctor, Henri
Leclerc. Today it’s a mainstay in Europe and many other parts of the
world for total heart health.</p>
<p>
The Department of Chemistry at Cork Institute of Technology
(CIT) showcased hawthorn’s medicinal properties in the medical
journal <span class="italic-font">Pharmacognosy Review</span>. Commenting on its proven efficacy,
they highlighted hawthorn’s safety, saying it has no herb-drug interactions and is highly recommended “in treatment strategies surrounding cardiovascular disease, especially in the early stages of disease progression.<sup>”(14)</sup></p>
<p>
Confirming these findings, <span class="italic-font">The American Journal of HealthSystem Pharmacy</span> published that “Hawthorn is a fruit-bearing shrub</p>

treatment of digestive ailments, dyspnea, kidney stones, and cardiovascular disorders. Today, hawthorn is used primarily for various
cardiovascular conditions. The cardiovascular effects of hawthorn
are believed to be the result of positive inotropic [relaxed heart contractions] activity, ability to increase the integrity of the blood vessel wall and improve coronary blood flow, and positive effects on

Consumed for over 6000 years, cayenne peppers contain a family of compounds known as capsaicinoids. It wasn’t until the early
2000’s that cayenne’s true medicinal properties were elucidated.

<p>ical medicine for pain and orally for cardiovascular and anti-clotting
benefits. They’re also a great tool for endurance athletes, courtesy of
enhancing circulation and oxygen distribution.</p>
<p>
To temper the stress put on arteries, whole herb cayenne works
as a vasodilator (meaning it widens the blood vessels) and decreases the production of compounds made by the brain that cause high
blood pressure. It also works directly on the smooth muscle tissue
of coronary arteries to halt or slow the inflammatory process that
leads atherosclerosis. Working overtime at protecting the heart,
cayenne also inhibits excessive platelet aggregation, which means
that—similar to hawthorn—it stops blood clots without causing
excessive bleeding.</p>
<p>
In 2012 positive evidence for heart-healthy cayenne compounds
became so common that the American Chemical Society (ACS)
published the cardiovascular findings of Zhen-Yu Chen, PhD, a professor of Food and Nutritional Science at the Chinese University of
Hong Kong. “We concluded that capsaicinoids [cayenne actives]
were beneficial in improving a range of factors related to heart and
blood vessel health.” Among them were the inhibition of a gene that
produces a compound that forces muscles around blood vessels to
constrict—known as cyclooxygenase-2. By blocking it, muscles are
better able to relax and widen, allowing for more blood to flow
when taking whole herb capsaicin from cayenne.<sup>(15)</sup></p>
<p>
Most recently, researchers writing for medical journal <i>Open Heart</i>
published their findings after reviewing the effects of orally administered cayenne to rodents. In a paper titled, “Capsaicin May Have
Important Potential For Promoting Vascular and Metabolic Health,”
they showed that cayenne stimulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase
(eNOS) activity, which is vital for opening up arteries and ensuring</p>

better artery function, reduction in atherosclerosis (most notably in
diabetics) and a decrease in angina. It also slowed progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and curbed thickening of the heart, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, obesity, and gastric ulceration.<sup>(16)</sup></p>
<p>
One challenge to cayenne supplementation is the discomfort
that many people expect from hot peppers such as gastrointestinal
(GI) distress and acid reflux. To overcome this, it’s best to take a
cayenne product that is formulated with the stomach-coating and
protecting abilities of marshmallow root. Used for more than 2,000
years, this risk-free root comes as a tea, tincture, or supplement.
Producing a cooling type effect, it allows for cayenne use without GI
distress, stomach discomfort, or acid reflux.</p>

<p>And finally, there’s rauwolfia. This ancient, Ayurvedic medicine
was first written about in Sanskrit as Sarpagandha and Chandra. In the
early 16th century, German physician Leonhard Rauwolf studied the
plant while traveling in India. The natural medicine was so effective for
his patients that it soon became synonymous of the doctor’s name.</p>
<p>
Later, in the 1950s, rauwolfia’s undeniable ability to safely lower
blood pressure prompted chemists to study and isolate its active
ingredients. A family of alkaloids was identified, and the medicinal
extract—reserpine—was believed to be the most pharmacologically
active—but today we know it’s the synergy of all the alkaloids that
lends safety and efficacy. Ciba Pharmaceuticals (now Novartis)
began selling the natural extract and the medicine’s vast benefits
went mainstream. But it was soon lost to newer, more profitable,
synthetic versions of the medicine.<sup>(17,18)</sup></p>
<p>

In 1954, after widespread use, Joseph Monachino wrote about
rauwolfia’s effectiveness and safety. Writing for <i>Economic Botany</i>, he
stated that rauwolfia “had recently been admitted in American and
European clinical medicine as hypotensive and hypnotic drugs. In
addition to lowering blood pressure quite efficiently, apparently without dangerous side-effects, habit formation, withdrawal symptoms or
contraindication, these drugs have a sedative or tranquilizing action,
said to result from a depressing effect on the hypothalamus.<sup>”(19)</sup></p>
<p>
Unfortunately since then, rauwolfia has been largely forgotten.
It started with erroneous statements accusing the natural compound
of increasing breast cancer and other illnesses. All were baseless and
simply the result of an orchestrated media campaign to get rid of
rauwolfia as a safe and effective treatment for dangerously high
blood pressure. It worked and ever since, pharmaceutical medications have stolen the limelight. </p>

single physician who has even heard of rauwolfia or its health benefits,
let alone understands how best to use it. Fortunately for readers, you
can get this natural medicine at Amazon.com without a prescription
(see product pick).</p>
<p>
Using rauwolfia takes a bit of self-experimentation. To start, an
average of 100 to 500mg per day of whole herb rauwolfia is suggested for those with extreme, chronic high blood pressure.
Splitting the dose to twice per day is most beneficial for anyone who
needs the drastic lowering effects. Otherwise, for general use, it can
be taken once in the evening to curb high blood pressure and to also
encourage sleep. If taking with hawthorn and cayenne, less rauwolfia is more. In other words, 50 to 300mg per day might be sufficient instead of the higher doses mentioned above. Beware: excessive fatigue is a sign of taking too much.</p>

<p>Yet amazingly, all three forgotten cures are still available for use
among those who are privy to their benefits! The switch is as simple as
weaning off meds and deciding which product or combo of products
is best for you. In a matter of weeks, you’ll experience greater energy
and weight loss, courtesy of your hormones rebounding.</p>
<p>
It’s important to note that when making the switch to natural
medicine, your blood pressure numbers may not hit the extreme
lows that they did while you were on meds. That doesn’t mean the
natural cures “aren’t working”! Artificially low blood pressure numbers are considered drug-induced lows and are not reflective of true
health.</p>
<p>
Most people forget this and go into a panic as soon as their numbers creep back up to a normal, healthier level, when on natural products. But rest assured, you don’t need to adhere to the goal of maintaining blood pressure levels at or near 140/80 (or worse, 115/75)—
artificially low numbers that have been pharmaceutically encouraged.
When combining all three natural cures—hawthorn, cayenne and
rauwolfia—you may be able to lower your blood pressure as needed
to match your doctor’s goals or the goal of your insurance company,
safely and temporarily, but I don’t recommend it.</p>

companies could sell you cholesterol-lowering drugs (statins). The
myth of “high cholesterol” is so prevalent that The American
Academy of Pediatrics and The American Heart Association issued
guidelines allowing children as young as 8 years old to be placed on
cholesterol-lowering drugs. Yet there isn’t a single study to support
the claim that high cholesterol is even dangerous. Considering the
many side effects of statins, childhood mortality rates are poised to
go through the roof!

leaving patients with a host of auto-immune disorders.</p>
<h3>The Art of Turning Healthy People into Patients</h3>
<p>
Choosing sexy-time with a carny inside of a smoky, beat-up RV as
an alternative to taking cholesterol-lowering meds might seem a bit
extreme to some. But the system is designed to create this status quo
and make people think toxic meds are OK. The uninformed are
easy to fool.</p>

<p>Think about it. When was the last time you were taught anything substantial about medicine? Instead you’re bombarded with
drug commercials consisting of 15 seconds of benefits, followed by
45 seconds of side effects</p>

<p>This lack of education helps the industry swindle your uninformed ass into taking drugs. If you can look beyond the Kardashians
and political antics for a few minutes, you’ll see this corporate business
model in plain sight. It makes you fear an unknown or misunderstood
enemy and offers a false, albeit profitable, solution</p>

<p>According to the American Heart Association (AHA) (another
arm of the pharmaceutical industry), over 105 million Americans
have total cholesterol levels of 200 mg/dL or higher. To the pharmaceutical industry, this equates to 105 million potential customers. In order to turn these millions of people into patients,
America has been told this cholesterol level is bad for them—so the
lower the better. (You were probably also incorrectly taught that eating too many egg yolks is bad for you, because eggs yolks contain</p>

Rising cholesterol is not a disease—it’s simply an observation of
biology. Imagine how ridiculous it would be to say that “Most people with heart disease have a refrigerator; therefore, a fridge is the
cause of it.” High cholesterol is no different. In other words it’s a fact
of life, not a sign of illness.</p>
<p>
With dollar signs in their eyes, drug companies have launched
a massive fear campaign to warn people about cholesterol. Being led
by the pharmaceutically-compliant National Cholesterol Education
Program (NCEP), the campaign convinced nearly the entire world
via the media that LDL cholesterol is bad and that total cholesterol
levels should remain below 200 mg/dL in order to prevent heart
disease. (Of the nine nerdy members of the NCEP, eight had financial ties to cholesterol-lowering drug makers like Pfizer, Merck,
Bristol-Myers Squibb, and AstraZeneca. This fact was concealed
when the NCEP made its recommendations public.)</p>
<p>
The professional alarmists of the NCEP successfully created a
“cholesterol problem” in the minds of millions. Meanwhile, they provided a false solution: cholesterol-lowering drugs. This scheme
worked, because prior to the scary advertising disguised as education,
nobody even knew what the hell cholesterol was. Hundreds of millions of people had no idea they were even “sick”. . . think about that!
As a young kid, I had a hunch that most people were stupid,
including some of my high school teachers. (Maybe that’s why I
skipped school so often.)</p>
<p>
I was wrong. People <span class="italic-font">are fuckin’ incredibly</span> stupid.
The so-called disease of “high cholesterol” causes no fever, no
coughing, no labored breathing, no heart palpitations, no hormone</p>

who doesn’t feel sick that they’re suffering from a terminal illness
like “hypercholesterolemia”—a term invented to describe high cholesterol—and subsequently get them to take meds, every day, for
life? Through ignorance, that’s how.</p>
<p>
I’ve done some stupid things throughout my life. I rafted the
Pacuare River in Costa Rica during a flood. As we busted through
muddy swaths of man-eating waves, boulders smashed into each
other and echoed beneath our raft on the river bottom as the rogue
current pushed them downstream. Another time, while traveling
through Mexico, I pierced my nipples to see what it would feel like
(I was sober). As a hostile teen, I even got caught up in a high-speed
police chase, which ended with a loaded gun being pressed to my
temple.</p>
<p>
Even after all of that, I’m proud to say I’ve never been scammed
by the cholesterol-lowering drug rip-off. I’ve always known it’s
nothing more than a home run heist for Wall Street.</p>
<p>
Pfizer’s blockbuster drug Lipitor became the first prescription
drug to make more than $10 billion in annual sales. In 2017,
Forbes Magazine showed statins are earning drug pushers $26 billion in annual sales—that’s greater than the combined GDP of <i>more
than half the nations</i> on Earth! Outrageous.</p>
<p>
Do you think that’s enough money to take over medical journals
with ghostwriting, ads, and lobbying? Pharma has profited so hugely, they can push the cholesterol-lowering agenda even further by
instilling as much fear into the public as they want.</p>

				<h3>Question #1. Explain to me why EVERYONE should have
the same exact cholesterol level?</h3>
<p>
This is a legit question. Stating that everyone should have the same
cholesterol levels is like asserting that all women should have the
same sized breasts and all men should have the same sized package.
(Wait, scratch that. Bad analogy.) Should all people have the same
shoe size?—and if they don’t, it means their foot needs surgery?!
</p>
<p>
This is stupid thinking. If your doctor insists that we should all
have cholesterol levels below 200 mg/dL, then ask him or her:</p>
<h3>Question #2. What are some studies I could read to
learn more about high cholesterol being dangerous?</h3>
<p>
Your doctor may go into a well-crafted sales pitch about how high
cholesterol is responsible for plaque build-up among the arteries of
the heart. But that’s ridiculous because cholesterol is found everywhere in the body. This means so-called “high” levels would be
blocking off all regions, not just those of your heart.</p>
<p>
Cadaver studies show that 90% of the time, blockage only
occurs within the coronary arteries, not among other parts like legs,
arms, fingers, or anywhere else. So by definition, cholesterol can’t
be the cause of blockage—because cholesterol is everywhere in the
body. It does not cause plaque everywhere when it rises. (If it did,
then there would be plaque everywhere in your body.)</p>

<p>Plus, <i>Time Magazine</i> highlighted the science showing that “most
heart attack victims have LOW cholesterol.” This just confirmed the
findings of scientists at The University of California Los Angeles who
announce, “A new national study has shown that nearly 75 percent of
patients hospitalized for a heart attack had [low] cholesterol levels</p>

event, based on current national cholesterol guidelines.” Therefore, if
high cholesterol actually caused plaque, then why the hell do most
heart attack victims have low cholesterol levels?<sup>(2)</sup></p>
<p>
Fact is, there are no studies proving that high cholesterol causes
plaque. Not one. Cholesterol is very important for the body, and levels over 200 mg/dL will never kill you. Just the opposite, research
shows that higher cholesterol is healthy as you age! There are plenty
of studies to prove that! If you remember only one thing from this
chapter, it should be <i>the higher your cholesterol, the longer you live.</i></p>

	<h3>5 Facts About Cholesterol Your Doctor Doesn’t Know</h3>

<p>Cholesterol is a versatile compound that is vital to the functioning
of the human body. Just like everything else, cholesterol levels differ greatly among individuals. In humans, cholesterol serves five
main functions:
</p>

<ol type="1">

	<li><p>Cholesterol is used by the body to manufacture
steroids, or cortisone-like hormones, including the
sex hormones. These hormones include testosterone,
estrogen, and cortisone. Combined, these hormones
control a myriad of bodily functions</p></li>

    <li><p>Cholesterol helps the liver produce bile acids. These
acids are essential for proper digestion of fats and in
ridding the body of waste products.</p></li>


<li><p>Cholesterol acts to interlock “lipid molecules,” which
stabilize cell membranes. Like pieces of a puzzle,
cholesterol is the building block for all bodily tissues.

	            </div>
				</div>

				<div class="content-center">
				<ol type="1" start="4">

					<li><p>Cholesterol is an essential part of the myelin sheath.
						Similar to the coating on copper wire, the myelin
						sheath ensures that the brain functions properly by
						aiding the passage of electrical impulses. Without the
						myelin sheath, it becomes difficult to focus and we
						can lose memory. This is why people on cholesterollowering drugs are notorious for having bad memory.
						Few users recognize this side effect because they forgot
						how important having a memory was.</p></li>

				    <li><p>Cholesterol has beneficial effects on the immune system. Men with high cholesterol have stronger immune
							systems than those with low cholesterol. This is proven
							by them having more strains of probiotics and assassinlike cells from the immune system that fend off foreign
							invaders.</p></li>

				</ol>
				<p>
				As you can see, cholesterol is pretty fucking beneficial. Without
				enough of it, you’re screwed. Artificially lowering your cholesterol
				with drugs is a death wish. Due to its vast importance, cholesterol
				must be circulated to all parts of the body via the estimated 100,000
				miles of arteries and veins within the adult human body. To understand how cholesterol circulates through the body, recall the fact that
				oil and water do not mix. Cholesterol is an oily substance (termed a
				lipid) and cannot blend smoothly with water-based blood. In order to
				transport this non-water soluble lipid through the bloodstream, the
				body packages cholesterol into special “vehicles” called lipoproteins.</p>

	<h3>The Truth About HDL and LDL Cholesterol</h3>
<p>The main cholesterol-carrying vehicle in the body is termed lowdensity lipoprotein or LDL. Because LDL carries the lipid known as
cholesterol, it’s referred to as LDL cholesterol. (Technically, LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol aren’t even true cholesterol molecules—
which makes the theory of “bad cholesterol” even more ludicrous. It’s
just empty sales rhetoric designed to instill fear in the public.)</p>
<p>
Another form of lipoprotein (and there are many) is high-density lipoprotein or HDL cholesterol. The notion that one form of cholesterol is “bad” and the other is “good” is as real as the Easter
Bunny. This commonly mistaken notion is based on the fact that
LDL cholesterol has been found to be one of many components of
arterial plaque, along with saturated fat, calcium, and cholesterol.
Meanwhile, HDL has been shown to transport cholesterol back to
the liver. That’s it.</p>
<p>
Whether a person’s cholesterol is high or low, LDL cholesterol
will still become a component of plaque. Plaque is simply a necessity of life. The body is programmed to save itself by using cholesterol of all kinds, regardless of their levels. Therefore, no relation to
the amount of LDL cholesterol in the blood and the severity of
plaque exists, whatsoever.</p>
<p>
Plaque is nature’s “Band Aid” to the damaged inner layer of the
artery, known medically as the endothelium. Without the packaging
of LDL cholesterol, we would not be alive. How can LDL cholesterol
be bad? It’s like saying the immune system is harmful to us because
it attacks biological nasties in our body.</p>
<p>
Having grasped what cholesterol really is, we can now move on
to understanding its relationship to heart disease (i.e., atherosclerosis). Once you learn the basics of how heart disease develops, you</p>

<h3>What Really Causes Heart Disease?</h3>

<p>Atherosclerosis is the hardening and narrowing of the arteries. It’s an
inflammatory response initiated by damage to the endothelium. The
endothelium is the innermost layer of the arteries. Damage to the
endothelium can happen anywhere in the body, but 90% of the time
it happens in the spaghetti-sized arteries of the heart (coronary
arteries), probably due to the mechanical stress in this region.
If you want to preserve your heart health, don’t bother trying to
artificially lower your LDL cholesterol levels. It’s far more important
to prevent damage to the endothelium of the arteries. Many biological disturbances, including poor lifestyle habits, can damage the
inner layer of the coronary artery. </p>

<h3>10 Reasons Why You Might Have Heart Disease:</h3>


<ul>
	<li> Oxidative stress</li>
	<li> Infection</li>
	<li> Smoking</li>
	<li> Type II diabetes (Beat it in 30 days by reading Over-TheCounter Natural Cures Expanded) </li>
	<li>  Increased levels of homocysteine attributed to lack of folate
and nutritive B vitamins (best source of these vitamins are
Brewer’s Yeast and whole eggs)</li>

	</ul>
	
<p>To protect your heart, work on eliminating all of the above
“inflammatory disturbances” from your life. By doing so, you’ll prevent plaque build-up and the subsequent atherosclerosis or premature death that may follow</p>
<p>
Once damage occurs to the inner layer (endothelium) of the coronary artery, the body’s natural repair mechanism takes over. This is
because as humans, we’re equipped with a natural instinct to live. The
repair mechanism begins by circulating levels of low density lipoproteins (LDLs) into the damaged area, particularly between the smooth
muscle layer and endothelium of the artery. Once LDLs move into the
damaged area of the endothelium, an alteration in endothelium function takes place. This alteration begins the inflammation cascade. </p>
<p>
To signal for help, the endothelium begins producing reactive
oxygen species (ROS). Like a citizen calling 911, this attracts the
immune cells to the damaged site, which forms a protective shield
around the damaged area of the blood vessel. Eventually, the combination of LDL, immune cells, muscle cells, and debris from the
initial damage create “plaque.”</p>
<p>
The most important thing to understand is that plaque is
nature’s fix to damage within the arterial wall. Plaque forms in
response to this damage, regardless of LDL cholesterol levels. This,
in part, explains why researchers have failed to find a correlation
between levels of cholesterol and the growth of atherosclerosis.
</p>
<p>
If damage to the endothelium persists, atherosclerotic plaque
accumulates on the arterial walls. This leads to decreased blood</p>

kidneys, penile reaction, and eventually every bodily system.</p>
<p>
Over time, build-up of atherosclerotic plaque initiates heart
attack and stroke. Sometimes this happens without warning. As the
artery narrows, tiny blood clots (which are normally harmless)
become a death threat. In normal circumstances, these tiny blood
clots are usually capable of passing through a healthy artery—but
when the artery is narrowed, they get caught in the plaque and prevent blood flow. If an artery is blocked in the heart, a heart attack is
the result. If a blockage occurs in the brain, a stroke is the result.
Quitting sugar and supplementing with folate-rich Brewer’s Yeast
and nattokinase (as taught in next chapter) can delay and stop the
premature progression of plaque.</p>

<p>need to do is look at large populations of humans and measure their
cholesterol levels and longevity, and the truth becomes clear: there
is no such thing as “the disease of high cholesterol.” Trying to lower
cholesterol with medications to below whatever the status quo
number might be for that given year, is suicide. There are plenty of
studies from around the world to prove this.</p>
<p>
Researchers at the University of San Diego called attention to
epidemiological studies showing that high cholesterol in people
over 75 years of age is protective, rather than harmful. Reported by
<i>BBC News</I>, Professor Beatriz Rodriquez of the University of Hawaii
in Honolulu and colleagues found that men over age 70 who had
cholesterol levels between 200 to 219 milligrams per deciliter
(mg/dL) were less likely to develop heart disease than those with
low cholesterol levels. Elderly men with cholesterol levels of below
160 mg/dL had a 55% greater risk of heart disease.<sup>(3)</sup></p>
<p>
Other researchers have arrived at similar conclusions. The
<i>European Heart Journal</i> published the results of a three-year study
involving 11,500 patients. Researcher Behar and associates found
that in the low cholesterol group (total cholesterol below 160
mg/dL), the relative risk of death was 2.27 times higher compared
to those with higher cholesterol. The most common cause of death
in the low cholesterol group was cancer, with liver disease being
second. Behar’s study also linked low blood cholesterol levels less
than 160 mg/dL to a twofold-increased risk of death from cancer of
the liver, pancreas, and organs that form red blood cells.<sup>(4)</sup></p>
<p>
These same researchers showed that healthy men without any history of cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, or liver disease—who lower
their total cholesterol—have an increased risk of prostate cancer,
intracranial hemorrhage, respiratory, kidney, and digestive disease.</p>

				<p>The most widely respected medical journal, <i>The Journal of the
American Medical Association,</i> published a study entitled: “Cholesterol
and Mortality. 30 Years of Follow-up from the Framingham Study.”
Shocking to most readers, this in-depth study showed that after the
age of 50, there is no increased overall death rate associated with
high cholesterol! There was, however, a direct association between
low levels (or dropping levels) of cholesterol and increased death.<sup>(5)</sup></p>
<p>
Medical researchers reported that cardiovascular death rates
increased by 14% for every 1 mg/dL drop in total cholesterol levels
per year! That means that every incremental decline in cholesterol
led to a corresponding drop in longevity.</p>
<p>
Here’s the ugly truth: the lower your cholesterol is, the more
fucked up your body and health become. (Doesn’t that make you
want to slam the nearest cholesterol-lowering drug down your
throat?!)</p>
<p>
For those who have already suffered from heart failure, lowering
cholesterol only exacerbates the problem . . . like pouring gasoline
over a fire. It’d be better to let your cholesterol rise to naturally
higher levels. The <i>Journal of Cardiac Failure</i> published the findings
of Horwich and colleagues in a paper, “Low Serum Total Cholesterol
is Associated with Marked Increase in Mortality in Advanced Heart
Failure.” In their analysis of 1,134 patients with heart disease, they
found that low cholesterol was associated with worse outcomes in
heart failure patients and impaired survival, while high cholesterol
improved survival rates. Interesting to note, their findings also
showed that elevated cholesterol among patients was not associated
with hypertension, diabetes, or coronary heart disease.<sup>(6)</sup></p>
<p>
Low cholesterol has also been linked to depression and anxiety.
Dr. Edward Suarez of Duke University found that women with low</p>

<p>cholesterol levels (below 160 mg/dL) were more likely to show
signs of depression and anxiety relative to women with normal or
high cholesterol levels. In 2003 Duke University showed a 20%
absolute increase in depression among those taking cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins. Their results add to the literature linking cholesterol and mood.<sup>(7)</sup></p>
<p>
The <i>Scandinavian Journal of Primary Health Care </i> published the
results of a study looking at cholesterol levels and death among
100,000 patients over the age of 50 years old. Their evidence
showed the exact opposite of what Big Pharma insists. Reporting the
raw data, the scientists wrote, “For the groups with the highest total
cholesterol level, the mortality becomes significantly lower in the
oldest age group compared with the group with the lowest total
cholesterol.” They echoed what many researchers before them
found: “These associations indicate that high lipoprotein levels
[cholesterol] do not seem to be definitely harmful in the general
population.”<sup>(8)</sup></p>
<p>
If you think lowering your total cholesterol level will protect
you from heart disease, you may want to seriously rethink your
strategy. Lowering cholesterol, whether by prescription drugs or
dietary supplements like red yeast rice, has proven to be dangerous
and goes against centuries of scientific research findings. High cholesterol is protective rather than detrimental.</p>

				<p>every person should have the same cholesterol level? Why is there
such widespread acceptance of the cholesterol myth?</p>
<p>
The belief that low cholesterol prevents heart disease is the
result of selective citation rather than scientific results. Selective
citation is the art of conveniently citing supportive studies while
burying the unsupportive ones.</p>
<p>
In addition to smothering unsupportive studies from our medical history, pharmaceutical companies who sell cholesterol-lowering drugs produce brochures, web pages, and various other publications to broadcast the cholesterol-lowering myth to millions. As
pointed out by the previous editor of the <i>New England Journal of
Medicine, Jerome</i> P. Kassirer, MD, major publications such as <i>Lipid
Letter, Lipids Online,</i> and <i>Lipid Management</i> are supported and funded by cholesterol-lowering drug makers.</p>
<p>
Reaching millions of medical doctors, these publications relentlessly warn of the false dangers of high cholesterol in an attempt to
nudge doctors into prescribing cholesterol-lowering drugs. This not
only ensures that drug companies profit—it also promotes the cholesterol-lowering myth. Preferential citation, combined with paid
publications aimed at medical doctors, guarantees that the pharmaceutical industry can “invent diseases” out of thin air, while also
providing the so-called remedy.</p>
<p>
Remember, cholesterol is one of the most important molecules
in the human body, especially for children whose bodies are still
developing. Its respective high and low levels do not cause heart
disease or prevent heart attack and stroke (except for people over
70—where higher cholesterol is shown to be protective). To truly
live young and disease-free, get your weight in check and adhere to
the principles of “nutrient logic” outlined in <i>Over-The-Counter</i>

Thousands of years ago, humans observed injured bears (not the
Chicago Bears) gnawing on the bark of white willow trees. Some
dude—probably an earlier rendition of The People’s Chemist assumed
the bears were doing it to relieve pain.<br>

After a long night of drinking away his frustrations with people
who talk more than they think, he decided to test his theory.
Hungover, the young chemist made a tea from the bark. It tasted
like shit. But almost instantly, his discomfort melted away.
Despite his gluttonous indulgence, the crushing pressure on his
head was gone. He suffered no side effects, didn’t have to pay for
anything, and didn’t have to grovel for a doctor’s prescription. It was
like he’d struck the natural medicine lottery. White willow bark</p>

<p>became the official pain reliever not only for bears, but also for
many other human party-goers astute enough to follow his lead.<br>

Greek physician Hippocrates heard about white willow bark. (He’s
the same guy whom nerdy nutritionists today quote ad nauseum as
saying, “Let food be your medicine and medicine be your food.”) Well,
thank God Hippocrates started taking tips from chemists. Medicine is
more interesting and a lot more fucking reliable than eating an apple a
day . . . and definitely more exciting at parties, if that’s what you’re into.
<br>
Eventually, the doctor put the real medicine to use and it
worked. White willow bark became the natural drug of choice for
pain relief. (It’s rumored that Hippocrates later said, “Chemists are
awesome tutors and fun to party with.”)
<br>
As time passed, Big Pharma heard about white willow bark and
got excited about profiting off this painkiller. This laid the groundwork for the eventual isolation and synthesis of a molecule known
as salicylic acid (SA)—one of many ingredients found in white willow bark and believed to be the primary pain reliever.
<br>
To their distress, the pharmaceutical industry couldn’t patent the
product and therefore couldn’t market the natural ingredient as their
own. (You can’t patent Mother Nature . . . yet.) In order to have a
monopoly, they had to alter SA so that it didn’t resemble the original
form. Carl R. Gerhardt, a chemist, was the first to do so in 1853.
<br>
Starting with the parent compound from white willow bark,
Gerhardt performed a series of laboratory reactions that created
newly formed derivatives of nature. Then he tested them for painrelieving abilities. His actions yielded a molecular cousin, a fake, a
knockoff named acetyl-salicylic acid (ASA). The newly devised “willow bark-wannabe” marked one of the earliest and most profitable
thefts from Mother Nature.

		<p> Bayer trademarked this knockoff as “Aspirin” in 1889. Some say
the name was derived from St. Aspirinius, a Neapolitan bishop who
was the patron saint against headaches.
<br>
As aspirin grew in popularity, its inherent risks also began surfacing. (So much for being a saint . . .) The small molecular change
brought with it big dangers. Like deflating a tire, aspirin depletes
the body of life-saving nutrients: folate, iron, potassium, sodium,
and vitamin C.
<br>
Symptoms associated with aspirin-induced nutrient depletion
include: anemia, birth defects, heart disease, elevated homocysteine
(a risk factor for heart disease), headache, depression, fatigue, hair
loss, insomnia, diarrhea, shortness of breath, pale skin, and suppression of the immune system.<sup>(1)</sup>
<br>
Internal bleeding is one of the biggest risks. Studies show that
aspirin users die sooner compared to non-users from the hemorrhaging. This cancels out any perceived or wished-for benefits in the
reduction of heart disease or cancer—so-called benefits that are
often hyped by Big Pharma.
<br>
Aspirin is a class of drugs known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Each year, a grossly underestimated 7,600
deaths and 76,000 hospitalizations occur in the United States from
the use of aspirin and other NSAIDs like Motrin, Aleve, and
Celebrex. Unfortunately, the FDA states that only about 10% of
deaths caused by NSAIDs are reported, so the real mortality count
is massively larger. The media is either oblivious to this or refuses to
acknowledge the elephant in the room.<sup>(2)</sup>
<br>
The same is true with doctors—they just turn the other way and
ignore the damage being done. Death caused by any NSAID is usually falsely attributed to the victim being either too damn sick or too

<p>damn old. This makes it easy for the medical industry to conceal the
side effects and overdoses of aspirin. Meanwhile, aspirin has been
pushed onto everyone via massive marketing scams.<br>

Today the average person has been trained to pop an aspirin at
the first sign of pain. Who’s behind this push? Look no further than
Bayer and the U.S. government. This incestuous relationship was
spawned before anyone of us were even born. A look through the
history books blows the lid off it.<br>

In February 1917 the drug company Bayer lost its American
patent on aspirin. They were poised to lose beaucoup-bucks. The
profit floodgates were opened up for other companies to make
money from selling the chalky white pills.<br>

Bayer wasn’t going down without a fight.<br>

Partnering with the U.S. military in 1918, Bayer ensured that
troops were intentionally diagnosed with the flu. Even the smallest
anomaly in health—fatigue, high temperature, sore throat, dehydration or viral infection—brought an official flu diagnosis to an
estimated 50 million people. Reacting to these fake diagnoses, the
pharmaceutically compliant media reported that the globe was in
the midst of “quite possibly the deadliest plague known to
mankind.” Enter mass panic and chaos. The need for aspirin was
successfully spawned. Enter Bayer.<br>

Positioned as the benevolent savior, Bayer conveniently had
stockpiles of aspirin standing by. Always beholden to Pharma, the
surgeon general and the U.S. Navy recommended Americans “take
Aspirin to treat their flu symptoms.” Beaucoup tax money was
siphoned from the economy like a broken spring to pay for the military use of aspirin. Bayer and government officials who were financially connected to the money became rich beneficiaries.

		<p> (This siphoning of money from government to Big Pharma happens quite regularly, courtesy of artificially created “pandemics.”
This is a recurring theme throughout history and even today, as
you’ll soon see with vaccine promotions.)<br>

Fast forward to present time—Dr. Karen M. Starko has written
about the deadly effects of aspirin. Her writings suggest that during
the 1918 “calamity,” aspirin probably did more harm than good.
More specifically, aspirin—NOT the flu—is most likely what killed
many of the people who took it during the so-called “historical flu
outbreak!” In the mad rush to protect corporate and government
profits, people’s lives were lost while Bayer’s profits enriched.<sup>(3)</sup>

But in 1918 the American population was in the grips of mass
delusion and had no idea that the cure was killing them. Aspirin
was considered their “wonder drug.” Bayer launched an aggressive
advertising campaign, spoon-feeding Americans lie after lie about
how “pure” their newly, un-patented aspirin was. (Never mind that
even back then, a first year chemistry student could yield pure
aspirin in the lab.)<br>

Meanwhile, the so-called “flu epidemic” was reaching its peak.
People fell for the lies and gobbled up aspirin like it was Cheerios.
After many of them died, their deaths were conveniently blamed on
the flu.<br>

Playing their role in spreading mass delusion, the always pharmaceutically <i>compliant Journal of the American Medical Association</i>
suggested people swallow 1,000 milligrams of aspirin every three
hours to treat the flu! Do the math—that’s like taking 25 standard
325-milligram aspirin tablets in a 24-hour period. It was a moneymaking heyday for Bayer and a curse for patients. Not much has
changed since 1918.

<div class="content-center">
<p>In 1986 Dr. Otis R. Bowen, the Secretary of Health and Human
Services, issued a warning reminding parents that children and
teenagers with flu symptoms “should not be given aspirin.” When
used for the flu or chicken pox, aspirin puts users at risk for Reye’s
syndrome, a disorder that causes organs to shut down and large
amounts of bloody, watery liquid to accumulate in the lungs.<sup>(4)</sup><br>

In time, pharmacologist John Vane discovered the deadly
actions of aspirin. On the one hand, he found that it blocks the production of an enzyme known as COX (cyclooxygenase).
Downstream this prevents inflammation, swelling, pain, and fever.
But on the other hand, it creates a risky trade-off. In addition to
being a COX inhibitor, aspirin also stifles the formation of healing
compounds made by the body. Crucial for physiological support,
these compounds protect the stomach from damage by hydrochloric acid, maintain kidney function, and stop internal bleeding. Once
the body is exposed to the deadly blood thinner, ulcers, kidney failure, and internal bleeding ensue. Vane won the Nobel Prize for his
work and somehow the media is silent on his warning.<br>

Bayer wasn’t the slightest bit concerned about these award-winning
findings. Like doctors, they simply ignored the Nobel Prize-winning
science. Expanding their market reach, they pushed “baby” aspirin (i.e.,
low dose aspirin) to protect against heart attack, stroke, and cancer. But
the infantile dose proved just as harmful as the regular dose.<br>

Writing for <i>The New York Times,</i> Dr. Neena S. Abraham said, “If
your physician has suggested you take aspirin to reduce your risk of
heart disease, it is important to remember that even small doses of
daily aspirin—including ’baby aspirin,’ at a dose of 81 milligrams
daily—can increase your risk of ulcers and bleeding.” Buffered or
enteric-coated aspirin won’t protect you, either.

		<p>Judith P. Kelly of the Slone Epidemiology Unit at the Boston
University School of Medicine warned that “all forms of aspirin
carry risk.” Protective covering or not, the white pill still paralyzes
the production of physiologically-important compounds in our
body.<br>

The natural predecessor, white willow bark tea, remains the
safer option for pain relief. Even if you’re “allergic” to aspirin, the
tea is a fantastic alternative for pain relief or even high fevers, as it
doesn’t contain the problematic ASA (acetyl-salicylic-acid) that
spurs most allergic reactions.<br>

Due to the drug’s inherent risks, it’s best to ignore aspirin for
cardiovascular health. In other words, you’re not going to protect
your heart by taking aspirin. Fortunately, unruly blood clots that
lead to heart attack and stroke are best curbed using hawthorn and
cayenne (as outlined in <i>Over-The-Counter Natural Cures Expanded</i>).
For those who have been diagnosed with heart disease, or who are
looking for total cardiovascular health, nattokinase is among the
safest and most effective aspirin alternatives.

<h3>Mother Nature’s Healthier Alternative to Aspirin</h3>
<p>A traditional Japanese food, nattokinase is an enzyme derived from
fermenting soy beans with the fungus known as <i>Bacillus subtilis
natto.</i> It has been used as a traditional meal as far back as 1600. It
wasn’t until 1987 that its clot-busting and cardio-protective qualities were discovered. To appreciate and trust its true value as an
aspirin alternative, you need to understand how blood clotting
works.
<br>
Blood clots themselves aren’t inherently risky. Their formation is
the result of a chemical cascade by which a blood compound
known as fibrinogen is converted into fibrin. This gives rise to a
scaffolding-like structure that halts blood flow, similar to a wash rag
blocking the drain.
<br>
When we bleed or are injured, the elastic, sticky fibrin molecules gather and thicken near a wound. The entire process is
mandatory for healing and is a true testament to our body’s natural
intelligence. But in excess, blood clots are known as silent killers for
their ability to incite heart attack and stroke.
<br>
This has doctors on high alert, leading them to aggressively recommend and use aspirin and other blood thinners like Plavix and
Coumadin, which dissolve clot-inducing fibrin . . . and unfortunately, many other parts of our body! In an emergency situation,
these meds have immense value. But using them daily (outside of
an emergency) comes with horrendous side effects. <i>In fact, repercussions from prescription blood thinners are the leading cause of hospitalization and adverse drug events. That’s because they launch an all-out
assault on our body’s natural healing process and shut down our innate
ability to regulate blood clotting.</i>

		<div class="content-center">
		<p>Nattokinase to the rescue, it works better, risk-free! But before
learning how to use it, you need to understand what causes blood
to thicken excessively and dangerously in the first place:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Dehydration</li>
<li>High triglycerides (excess sugar consumption)</li>
<li>Blood glucose greater than 125 mg/dL (normal is 90 to</li>
<li>100 mg/dL)</li>
<li>Inflammation, which gives rise to compounds known
as cytokines</li>
  </ul>

<p>Therefore, the best way to ensure healthy blood is to drink plenty of purified water or spring water, avoid sugar and excess fruits,
and take part in weight training to keep inflammation down. In
place of risky blood thinners, and outside of an emergency situation, you can use nature’s alternative to aspirin to properly regulate
the anti-clotting process so that fibrin doesn’t form excessive clots.
<br>
Nattokinase acts to control fibrin. It keeps it in check by limiting its potential to solidify. This ensures that the clingy compound
doesn’t yield too many or too few sticky clots! But there’s an even
more beneficial effect that comes from using nattokinase. It stops
inflammation within the arteries, which can lead to total blockage!
It’s like a Liquid Drano for your pipes!
<br>
One of the triggers for clotting is damaged arteries. Once injured,
platelets collect within the thin diameter to sooth the inflamed
area—like icing a knee. This often occurs due to stress and/or injury
caused by sugar and other factors mentioned previously. If in excess,
a myriad of sticky, adhesive compounds—including fibrin—begin to
congregate on the injured surface within the artery. Over time, this
facilitates total blockage, what’s technically known as an occlusion. </p>

<div class="content-center">
<p>In a comparison of aspirin and nattokinase, it was found that
nature’s alternative prevented and reduced the occlusion better and
far safer than the over-the-counter blood thinner! This one benefit
alone makes nattokinase mandatory for anyone who values total
cardiovascular health! Of course, doctors insist that safety might be
an issue . . . but that’s ludicrous because this supplement has never
put anyone in the emergency room!<br>

In fact, one of the most compelling studies showed that its anticlotting benefits lasted for up to 8 hours after one single dose of 100
mg, without any risk of toxicity or bleeding. Since 1996, these
actions have been the subject of dozens of studies around the world
that have all come to the same conclusion: 150 to 500 mg/kg of nattokinase per day is a safe and effective, non-toxic anti-clotting compound. Best of all, you won’t overdose and you don’t need a prescription.<sup>(5)</sup>

On November 7th, our home birth finally happened. My weightlifting, pregnant wife (who was featured in The <i>New York Times</i>,
Huffington Post, CNN, and The London Daily Mail for being a superfit mom) messaged, “It’s time.”

“Oh shit! I’ll be there in 4 minutes,” I texted back from The
People’s Chemist bunker in Los Angeles.<br>

“The midwives are on the way, right!?” I asked in a near panic.<br>

After rushing through the front door, I yanked out the hose and
adapter, air pump, tub, and slip cover—items we always used during our home births. Hauling ass, I left a sloppy trail of water down
the hallway to our bedroom from my previous test run days earlier.

<p>After all, I’m just a chemist—not a midwife, doctor, doula, or
anything associated with birthing a child. As a student of measurable and predictable outcomes, I examine all things relentlessly and
intently. I leave nothing to my imagination and follow everything
down to its simplest form. I probe until I can define the mystery
with a simplicity that baffles others.<br>

But that approach only works with chemical reactions and medicine.
Pregnancy keeps me in a constant state of bewilderment. It might
as well be magic. The entire process is like an algebraic equation you
can only follow for so long before you get lost in its complexity.
Therefore, my philosophy during home birth is, “Don’t interfere.”
Within seconds, the tub was ready. I hung the towels neatly over
the edge. Organic, Egyptian cotton sheets, gourmet dinner, and a
glass of wine awaited mom post-birth.<br>

The midwives knocked on the door.<br>

By 3:00 p.m., the entire family and midwives were circled
around the tub like it was a campfire. I gave Lily and Blair a nod of
confidence to let them know mom was gonna rock the home birth.
The midwife gave us all a few simple instructions. They carried the
same underlying message: Don’t freak out.<br>

Then time stopped.<br>

One minute I was soothing my kids, the next I was ready to
jump in the tub to hold my new baby’s head as it transitioned into
our world. Then, in another frame, our baby was stuck to Lea-Ann’s
chest like flung paint.<br>

I froze, waiting to hear a victory cry . . .<br>

At first glance, I was sure we had already met on an emotional
level. I felt like I was home. It was like a memory that’s felt, not
remembered. Our newborn was all of us, in one.

		<p> A cough came, then a cry followed. Victory!<br>
		
I don’t know what a newborn can or cannot see. But I do know
that once the crying started, our new baby looked up at mom and
calmed instantly—mom was instinctively safe and familiar.
<br>
At 3:46 p.m. Skyler was born.
<br>
Blair, my 8-year-old son, said the tub looked like a shark attack.
Pregnancy is unmerited sacrifice. For nine months, the soon-tobe-mother breaks her heart, her brain, and her back to get to that
final moment, where she still has to yield a Herculean effort to give
life, the way nature intended.
<br>
The mother’s body is simple yet behaves in complex ways we
have yet to understand. It’s made only from six elements of the periodic table. Together, these elements form DNA, which conveys
instructions for chemical reactions that create skin, lungs, a cage of
ribs for protection, a placenta, umbilical cord, and everything else
that make up a human being in only nine months.
<br>
During birth, Mom’s body becomes the baby’s. If nature had to
choose between the two who survives, it usually picks the baby.
Every fiber of mom’s muscle is directed to this one singular moment
of delivering the baby, safely, the way nature intended. Only the
strongest women can do it with grace. (I’ve had the privilege of seeing my wife do it four times, as of the writing of this book!)
<br>
In return, I’ve always tried to contribute by being vigilant about
our kids’ health and wellness. That started with our first daughter,
Lily, when Lea-Ann asked me, “Are we going to vaccinate?”
<br>
At the time, I was just out of graduate school and working as a
bench chemist for Big Pharma. I had access to every medical and
chemistry journal I needed to begin a relentless examination of vaccines. Our biggest concern was whether or not vaccines were safe

<p>and effective. And of course, if we decided to opt out, were we contributing to a breakdown in “herd immunity?” </p>
<h3>Herd Immunity: Why It Doesn’t Hold Up</h3>
<p>Herd immunity is a hypothesis plucked out of an old college text book.
It states that large groups of immune people can protect those who are
immune compromised or unvaccinated. In other words, herd immunity serves as a human shield—a type of immunity—for “at-risk” individuals. Without question, vaccines are said to induce it. But remember, it’s only a hypothesis . . . as old as 1840! It has never been proven.
<br>
To test herd immunity, you simply have to monitor a highly vaccinated (or even naturally-immune) group for an outbreak. If even
one person among the herd is infected and there’s a spread—then
obviously, herd immunity doesn’t work. This is exactly what has
been observed.
<br>
In Corpus Christi, where the vaccine rate was 99%, measles was
undeterred. Scientists writing for <i>The New England Journal of
Medicine</i> documented the spread of an outbreak among adolescents
who had received their shots. The scientists concluded that, “outbreaks of measles can occur in secondary schools, even when more
than 99 percent of the students have been vaccinated and more than
95 percent are immune.”<sup>(1)</sup>
<br>
Echoing these findings, <i>The American Journal of Public Health</i>
showed a 98% vaccine rate at a Massachusetts high school. This
high rate didn’t stop a measles outbreak from erupting among the
heavily vaccinated “herd.”
<br>
Proponents of herd immunity usually insist that outbreaks should
be met with yet more vaccines, reaching as high as 100% . . . but that’s

you’ve taken away people’s freedom.<sup>(2)</sup><br>

In Illinois the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) documented an outbreak despite a 100% vaccine rate in a
high school in Sangamon County. In Emerging Infectious Diseases,
scientists discovered whooping cough outbreaks among fully
“immunized” populations of children as well. Their research—published by the CDC—found that, “Vaccinated adolescents and adults
may serve as reservoirs for silent infection and become potential
transmitters to unprotected infants.”<sup>(3)</sup><br>

You can go as far back as the first test tube and find these same
results, repeated numerous times among different “herds.” That’s
because herd immunity (as well as vaccine-induced immunity) does
not fully exist outside of textbooks and pharmaceutical propaganda. In other words, you could vaccinate EVERYONE and there
could still be an outbreak.<br>

Ignoring or refusing to learn the facts when outbreaks arise,
health officials are quick to state that this vaccine failure is due to a
breakdown in “herd immunity.” Doctors parrot it, too, without even
looking at the research. They say it’s happening more often nationwide as states make it easier for parents to opt out of vaccinations.<br>

Like argumentative apes, pro-vaccine parents and their physicians start pounding their chests in favor of such statements. More
incredulously, they attack anti-vaccine parents, accusing them of
“putting vaccinated kids at risk due to a breakdown in herd immunity.” This is fuzzy logic. And it’s borderline stupid. After all, if vaccines truly worked, why would vaccinated kids be at risk? Isn’t the
vaccine supposed to protect them?

		<p> eradicating the paralyzing disease. However, when you look past
the industry-funded hype, the argument doesn’t hold up. In fact, it
proves that sometimes a vaccine can cause the very illness it’s trying
to prevent!<br>

Polio is the most feared childhood illness. It has caused paralysis and death throughout much of human history. Its mere mention
inspires terrifying images of crippled children and the Iron Lung.
However, these associations are more the result of Pharma-inspired
indoctrination than actual polio risk.
<br>
In 1910 the world experienced a dramatic increase in polio. This
spike in illness was the driving force behind the great race toward the
development of a polio vaccine. Mounting public fear became the
perfect sales opportunity for drug makers working alongside the
government (as usual). Here’s how the scheme played out.
<br>
Starting in the early 1940’s, the March Of Dimes (a "non-profit"
organization set up courtesy of the U.S. government) began grooming the public with a manipulative vaccine marketing campaign.
Feeding everyone gruesome images of crippled children, they used
sensationalist publicity to gain public favor of vaccines. (This was
prior to a single vaccine ever being developed or even studied.)
Essentially, the March of Dimes fabricated an epidemic that had not
yet occurred to win favor for a remedy (vaccine).
<br>
Once put into a fearful polio frenzy, people were emotionally
powerless to resist. The well-planned front group began siphoning
tax dollars away from the government and towards its own pharmaceutical companies in the name of polio immunization—a perceived
remedy by the public. Nine million dollars of government money
(worth a hundred million today) was doled out for “successful
immunization.” It was the perfect crime—scare the masses, use tax

they still use the same heist today to make billions worldwide.)
<br>
In 1953, as planned, the first official polio vaccine was developed and served up to a ravenous public. But the vaccine came too
late and was no longer needed. Thanks to improvements in hygiene,
sanitation, and nutrition, the rates of polio infection plummeted
before vaccine intervention began.
<br>
Infection rates also dropped for the Black Plague and many
other horrific illnesses for which vaccines were never developed!
These diseases were slowly eradicated naturally through a change in
human habits that favored better nutrition, hygiene and natural
immunity. This fact has been well documented, but always ignored.
Even the CDC acknowledged the phenomenon, stating, “The 19th
century shift in population from country to city that accompanied
industrialization and immigration led to overcrowding in poor
housing served by inadequate or nonexistent public water supplies
and waste-disposal systems. These conditions resulted in repeated
outbreaks of cholera, dysentery, TB, typhoid fever, influenza, yellow
fever, and malaria. By 1900, however, the incidence of many of
these diseases had begun to decline because of public health
improvements, implementation of which continued into the 20th
century. Local, state, and federal efforts to improve sanitation and
hygiene reinforced the concept of collective “public health” action
(e.g., to prevent infection by providing clean drinking water).” Even
today, the risk of paralysis from polio infection is still only 1% of
those infected, just like it was in the early 1950s despite the media
insisting there was an “epidemic.<sup>”(4, 5)</sup>

		<p> ess common, many people falsely praised the vaccines—not better
hygiene, nutrition, or sanitation—for its defeat. In time, the vaccine
was celebrated for its so-called ability to eliminate the paralyzing virus,
while the drug’s side effects were ignored, buried, and forgotten.
<br>
In time, researchers around the world began learning of the
drug’s notorious side effects, one of which was polio itself. In other
words, they noticed the “medicine” was causing the very disease it
was intended to protect against.
<br>
<i>The Medical Journal of Australia</i> discovered “the relation of prophylactic [preventive] inoculations [polio vaccines] to the onset of
poliomyelitis [polio]” as far back as 1951 during early testing. In
their research they found increased polio outbreaks among the
“immunized.<sup>”(6)</sup>
<br>
In 2004 the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that
despite a three billion dollar effort to vaccinate as many people as
possible, “ten previously polio-free countries across Africa have now
been reinfected.” The United States showed the same trend. To
quote the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “From 1980
through 1999, a total of 162 confirmed cases of paralytic
poliomyelitis were reported, an average of 8 cases per year. . . . The
remaining 154 (95%) cases were vaccine-associated paralytic polio
(VAPP) caused by live oral polio vaccine.<sup>”(7)</sup>
<br>
Eerily similar to the March of Dimes heist in the 1950s, the Bill
and Melinda Gates Foundation has marched off with over <i>eight billion dollars</i> by convincing foreign governments like Africa and India
to foot the bill for more polio vaccines. In 2007 Reuters published
“Nigeria Fights Rare Vaccine-Derived Polio Outbreak,” showing
how the vaccine itself ignited outbreaks of polio in Nigeria, Chad,
and Angola.<sup>(8)</sup>

<div class="content-center">
<p>According to <i>The Indian Journal of Medical Ethics,</i> the polio vaccine program launched by Bill Gates paralyzed 47,500 children in
2011 alone. Indian doctors pleaded, “clinically indistinguishable
from polio paralysis, non-polio acute flaccid paralysis was directly
proportional to doses of oral polio received.” In other words, the
more people who got the shots, the more cases of paralysis the
country suffered from.<sup>(9)</sup>
<br>
The data is clear. Using the polio vaccine to defend vaccination
for its ability to immunize is a weak argument. If you dig even deeper, you can also trace the vaccine to other health complications like
cancer and immune deficiency. Pushing for mass vaccination is not
only ignorant, it’s criminal.
<br>
Today’s vaccines are, by definition, a crapshoot. Just like with
polio, the whooping cough vaccination came too late. Between
1900 and 1935, mortality rates due to whooping cough dropped by
79% in the United States. Yet the vaccine intended to eliminate it
(DTP and DTaP) wasn’t introduced until 1940.
<br>
Today those who have been “immunized” for pertussis are the
most susceptible to whooping cough. Researchers with the CDC publicly stated in 2002, “the number of infants dying from whooping
cough is rising, despite record high vaccination levels.” In 2009 The
<i>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i> recognized the trend as well. In an article
titled, “Whooping Cough Vaccine not as Powerful as Thought,” the
publication highlighted a recent cluster of 18 whooping cough-infected students. Seventeen of those students—95% of those infected—
had been immunized with five doses of DTaP vaccine.<sup>(10)</sup>

Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) shot became widely used in
an effort to eradicate these three diseases. The CDC insisted the vac

		<p> cine would eliminate mumps in the United States by the year 2010.
But rather than preventing mumps and measles, the MMR shot has
actually caused widespread epidemics. Outbreaks have become the
norm. Those who have suffered the most were “vaccinated.” 
<br>
Between 1983 and 1990, there was a 423% increase in measles
cases among vaccinated individuals. In 2006 the largest mumps
outbreak in twenty years occurred. Among those infected, 63%
were “immunized,” as shown by Neil Z. Miller in <i>Vaccines: Are They
Really Safe and Effective?</i> Others found similar results. <i>In The Journal
of Infectious Diseases</i>, scientists from Vanderbilt University School of
Medicine wrote, “Vaccine failure accounted for a sustained mumps
outbreak in a highly vaccinated population.” 
<br>
In his book, <i>How to Raise a Healthy Child In Spite of Your Doctor,</i>
the late Dr. Robert Mendelsohn, MD, warned parents that vaccinated individuals are 14 times more likely to contract mumps than
unvaccinated individuals are.
<br>
Over time, these stunning vaccine failures led the Iowa Department
of Public Health to conclude, “. . . Our most important public health
tool against this disease—2 doses of MMR vaccine—is not providing
the necessary levels of protection to control mumps in the U.S. population.” Even the Mayo Clinic, which is a bastion of mainstream medicine, states, “vaccine failure has become increasingly apparent.<sup>”(11)</sup>
<br>
The flu vaccine has proven to be just as worthless. In 2007 the
CDC reported it had “no or low effectiveness” against influenza or
influenza-like illnesses. The data showed the flu vaccine protected
no more than 14% of those who received it. This wasn’t some fluke,
either. The vaccine is rarely any more effective than that.

<p>than four decades, is losing its reputation as an effective way to
ward off the virus.<sup>”(12)</sup>
<br>
Vaccine science has quite a bit of catching up to do before it
even remotely resembles the truth. If we are going to jab our children, then we at least need to know how these drugs work, so that
we can better understand their efficacy and safety. Until then, vaccine science is still experimental. Confirming this, The World
Health Organization (WHO) wrote, “To generate vaccine mediated
protection is a complex challenge. Currently available vaccines have
largely been developed empirically, with little or no understanding
how they activate the immune system.<sup>”(13)</sup>
<br>
Vaccine failure isn’t a scientific quandary or a mystery. It’s easy
to understand when you use uncommon sense. The immune system
is programmed to recognize and attack invaders that come through
the biological “front door,” not the skin. (The “front door” is comprised of the nose, mouth, and eyes.) This is especially true for
young children—their immune system simply does not recognize
biological invaders that come in through the skin (including weak
or dead infectious agents contained in a vaccine). In Immunization,
<i>Vaccines and Biologicals,</i> the WHO found, “Children under two years
of age do not consistently develop immunity following vaccination.<sup>”(14)</sup>
<br>
Doctors who do their homework understand that vaccines are ineffective. Dr. Ira Goodman, MD, FACS, ABIHM, a surgeon from Loyola
Medical School, is one of them. Through email correspondence, he told
me he is against vaccines simply because “they don’t work!”
<br>
Bottom line: vaccination is not the same thing as “immunization.” Vaccines don’t work. If they did, there wouldn’t be any outbreaks among the vaccinated.

		<p> Instead of admitting that vaccines don’t offer protection, health
officials and pharmaceutical companies continue to push for MORE
VACCINES as the solution! When you consider the growing history of vaccine failure—and the number of outright toxins contained
in these experimental concoctions—the implications for public
health are chilling.
		  </p>
		  <h3>Reason #2: Injecting Toxins into Kids is Risky</h3>
		  <p>Many parents insist that because they were safely vaccinated as kids,
then surely their own children can get shots. This would be true if
the vaccines of today were the same as they were decades ago—and
used on the same schedule—but of course, they’re not. It’s ludicrous
to think otherwise.
<br>
In 1960 an average of three vaccines were given to children. By
1983 this number shot up 800% to 24 doses! Today it’s a staggering
49 doses of 14 different vaccines, as recommended by the CDC.
That’s three times more than any other industrialized nation.
Meanwhile, our kids still carry the most illnesses. The culprit?
Vaccine toxins.
<br>
According to fact sheets released by the CDC and the FDA, vaccines today are brimming with toxins. These include dozens of
chemicals, heavy metals, and allergens—as well as the very objectionable monkey kidney cells (Vero cells) and aborted fetal tissue.
Sorry, but I have no interest in mainlining these toxic substances
into my vulnerable children in the name of “prevention.”
Formaldehyde is just one of many questionable chemicals found
in vaccines. According to the FDA, “Excessive exposure to
formaldehyde may cause cancer.” To date, childhood cancer rates</p>

The industry covers up this risk by assuring parents that formaldehyde is naturally produced by the body and that it’s completely safe.
This is nothing more than hot air—it offers absolutely zero proof of
safety and is a total injustice to vulnerable young children. Just because
your body produces something doesn’t mean you can drink it, eat it,
or inject it. It’s completely asinine to think otherwise.<br>

For example, the body produces hydrochloric acid (HCL) for
digestion. The stomach produces epithelial cells that churn out
bicarbonate to neutralize the acerbic compound. Drinking it, eating
it, or injecting it would be life-threatening—just like stabbing yourself with formaldehyde can cause leukemia or other forms of cancer
years later.<br>

Is anybody using their brain here?<br>

The National Toxicology Program and Department of Health
and Human Services countered the absurdity of insisting formaldehyde is safe. In their report to doctors, they stated, “Formaldehyde
is known to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of
carcinogenicity from studies in humans and supporting data on
mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Formaldehyde was first listed in the
Second Annual Report on Carcinogens in 1981 as reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence from
studies in experimental animals. Since that time, additional cancer
studies in humans have been published, and the listing status was
changed to known to be a human carcinogen in the Twelfth Report
on Carcinogens (2011).<sup>”(15)</sup><br>

Science Monitor</i> highlighted to doctors, “None of the compounds commonly used as preservatives in US licensed vaccine/biological preparations can be considered an ideal preservative, and their ability to fully

thimerosal is safe when used in doses found in vaccines. Taking a
pragmatic approach over a scientific one, the status quo insists,
“The active form of mercury in vaccines is different than that found
in contaminated fish,” and “only in trace amounts.” True. But both
forms are toxic. These government agencies will also parrot The
American Academy of Pediatrics who chirp, ”The continued benefits of thimerosal use in vaccine manufacturing clearly outweigh any
perceived risks.”<br>

You can’t make informed decisions about thimerosal based on
these ridiculous statements. Parents who do are in for a wake-up
call. A lifetime of unimaginable pain, suffering, isolation, and madness are lurking nearby for those who choose to play roulette with
the silvery sludge. Here’s what’s not being shown to parents . . .

<p>The last entity to fund a thimerosal study in the United States
was Eli Lilly, back in 1929. They’re not even a health agency; they’re
a pharmaceutical drug company. That hardly offers proof of safety
and efficacy. Their test churned out horrific results, showing that
100% of the kids jabbed with trace amounts of Merthiolate—the
trade name for thimerosal—died from meningitis. How could that
possibly be considered safe? Meanwhile, the Pharma-funded
authors (using ghostwriting) still concluded that there was no
causal association between mercury in vaccines and harm.
In time, the devastating effects could no longer be ignored. On
January 5, 1982, the FDA published its notice of proposed rulemaking regarding thimerosal. Their scientific panel’s opinions and
recommendations were the culmination of five years of research
concerning the potential hazards and safety of thimerosal.
Published in the Federal Register, the panel concluded:
</p>
<p><sup>“</sup>At the cellular level, thimerosal has been found to be more
toxic for human epithelial cells in vitro than mercuric chloride, mercuric nitrate, and merbromim (mercurochrome).<sup>”</sup></p>
<p><sup>“</sup>Exhibit 34 (Exhibit ELI-512). The FDA specifically found
that thimerosal was significantly more toxic for living tissue
than it was for the bacteria it was supposed to kill.<sup>”</sup></p>
<p><sup>“</sup>It was found to be 35.3 times more toxic for embryonic
chick heart tissue than for staphylococcus aureus [top killer
in hospitals today].<sup>”</sup>
</p>
<p><sup>“</sup>The Panel concludes that thimerosal is not safe for [overthe-counter] topical use because of its potential for cell
damage if applied to broken skin and its allergy potential.<sup>”</sup>

		<p> The FDA’s findings clearly should have settled the matter—that
thimerosal is not safe for humans, let alone children, to use.
<br>
In 2001 the pharmaceutical industry promised removal of
thimerosal from vaccines. Sadly, nine vaccine shots still contained
the metallic poison in the year 2016. The irony of promising to
remove a “safe” preservative is proof that thimerosal is risky. If you
need more proof, a little math goes a long way.<br> 

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s acceptable dose
for mercury is 0.1 microgram per kilogram of body weight, per day.
Running simple conversions, this means a 10-pound baby who gets
jabbed with a thimerosal-rich vaccine receives an insurmountable
55 times the safe upper limit for mercury exposure. For an adult
given the same injection, that’d be four times the safe supper limit!<br>

Pleading for thimerosal removal, Congressman Dan Burton
wrote to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make his
case. He insisted, “During a review required by the Food and Drug
Modernization Act, it was learned that infants receive more mercury [from thimerosal] in the first six months of life than is considered
safe according to federal guidelines. For a twelve-to-fourteen month
old child receiving vaccines on the Universal Childhood
Immunization Schedule as they are typically delivered (four to six
shots in one doctor visit), they may receive forty or more times the
amount of mercury than is considered safe according to
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines. The EPA guidelines were confirmed to be accurate through an independent evaluation conducted by the National Research Council (NRC).”<br>

If you read the vaccine package inserts, the danger of thimerosal becomes even more apparent. The DPT (diphtheria, pertussis,
and tetanus) vaccine maker Sanofi Pasteur warned, “A review by the

Makers of the Tripedia vaccine for DTaP (which is rich in
thimerosal) stated, “The vaccine is formulated without preservatives, but contains a trace amount of thimerosal [(mercury derivative), (≤0.3 µg mercury/dose)] from the manufacturing process.”<br>

		<p> Thimerosal has an evil twin, making the combo more dangerous
than the individual ingredients. Accompanying mercury is aluminum. Brought to the attention of doctors by <i>Nature</i>, evidence
from the <i>Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology</i>
found that both thimerosal at small concentrations and aluminum
are neurotoxic.<sup>(17)</sup><br>

The journal insisted, “In this regard, aluminum adsorbed vaccines caused a transient rise in brain tissue of mice. Indeed, in vitro
work showed that adjuvant-Al [aluminum] at levels comparable to
those administered to adults can kill motor neurons.” The outcome
was neurotoxicity, which leads to a higher risk of receiving special
education services and nerve cell deterioration, causing memory
loss and possibly dementia later in life.<br>

Consistent with these observations, an elaborate toxicological
report for aluminum prepared by the Agency for Toxic Substances
and Disease Registry (ATSDR) reported that, “There is a rather
extensive database on the oral toxicity of aluminum in animals.
These studies clearly identify the nervous system as the most sensitive target of aluminum toxicity.”
<br>
<i>In Current Medicinal Chemistry</i>, scientists warned that despite 90
years of widespread use of aluminum adjuvants, “their precise
mechanism of action remains poorly understood.” Digging deeper
into aluminum toxicity, they showed that aluminum presented in
vaccines “carries a risk for autoimmunity, long-term brain inflammation and associated neurological complications and may thus
have profound and widespread adverse health consequences. The
widely accepted notion of aluminum adjuvant safety does not
appear to be firmly established in the scientific literature and, as
such, this absence may have lead to erroneous conclusions

<p>regarding the significance of these compounds in the etiologies of
many common neurological disorders.”<sup>(18)</sup>
<br>
The assault from chemical threats isn’t the only concern. Many
vaccines are spiked with antibiotics like neomycin, polymyxin B,
streptomycin, and gentamicin—all of which can set off allergic reactions and threaten liver and kidney health. None of the these medications are even approved by the FDA for children.<br>

Interested in clinical observations from medical doctors, I reached
out to Dr. Suzanne Humphries, MD, to express my concern as a
chemist and father. She was adamant in her position: “Vaccines put
children most at risk for a form of kidney disease called nephrotic
syndrome. This can be caused by a common ingredient—Bovine
Serum Albumin. Doctors just give children steroids to suppress the
symptoms, never reporting it or knowing what the cause was.”<br>

These were some damn good reasons for my wife and I to avoid
vaccinating our kids. Doctors still insist that the benefits outweigh
these toxicity risks. But that would only be true if vaccination offered
guaranteed immunization. It doesn’t. That said, why would anyone
risk exposing their kids to toxins when there’s no guaranteed benefit—
especially when natural immunity is available to protect you?

<h3>Reason #3: Kids Can Build Immunity Naturally</h3>
<p>It’s a fact of life: invisible threats are everywhere. We’re all at risk
from various “biological nasties,” germs, and foreign invaders. A
single gram of feces can contain more than 10 million viruses, 1
million bacteria, 1,000 parasite cysts and 100 parasite eggs. From
the hands we shake, to the water we drink and the mats we wrestle
on, nowhere is safe . . . unless you’ve built up natural immunity in</p>

		<p>your body. This firewall acts as our God-given protection from the
incalculable number of threatening microorganisms.
<br>
Professor Sven Gard, member of the Staff of Professors of the
Royal Caroline Institute, identified the importance of our body’s
ability to protect itself. Speaking to The Nobel Prize Committee, he
warned that “The capacity of developing [natural] immunity is one
of the most important means of defense, of decisive importance for
the survival of the individual and the species.” Over time, some of
the world’s top scientific minds have begun focusing on demystifying the mysterious complexities of self-protection (i.e., natural
immunity) and how to harness it.<br>

One of the most interesting discoveries in natural immunity
occurred in 1908. Venerable scientists Ilya Mechnikov and Paul
Ehrlich revealed how our immune system is armed with a special set
of destroyer cells. Studying simple-celled aquatic life, they observed
how phagocytes eradicate infection by digesting them and subsequently eliminating them. Robust and resilient, the average person
has about six billion of these armed sentries ready to attack.<sup>(19)</sup>
<br>
In 2011 Bruce Beutler and Jules Hoffmann observed that the
immune system is pre-programmed to identify self and non-self.
This discovery single-handedly proved humans are hardwired to
build immunity, outside of vaccination. This work paved the way
for future scientists to discover how our body thwarts numerous
types of pathogenic microorganisms including bacteria, virus, fungi,
and parasites.<sup>(20)</sup><br>

Arguing in favor of vaccines, pro-vaccine parents insist that
newborns lack immunity. Pushing for more shots for everyone else,
they insist that herd immunity is the best protection for the young
and unvaccinated. They couldn’t be more wrong

<p>Natural immunity is a biological gift from our mothers and DNA.
According to more award-winning science, natural protection is fully
developed during the earliest stages of life. First, it’s passed from
<br>
mom and after a few weeks or months, it’s fully developed in newborns. Plus, thanks to “immunological memory,” natural immunity
lasts a lifetime. This explains why we’re protected from the millions
of other known microorganisms that we don’t have vaccines for!
Scientist Sir Peter Medawar and co-workers presented their
experimental evidence to prove the validity of immunological memory in 1960. The Nobel Prize committee awarded them for their
work, stating: “Immunity is our perhaps most important defense
against a hostile surrounding world. By penetrating analysis of
existing data and brilliant deduction, and by painstaking experimental research you have unveiled a fundamental law governing the
development and maintenance of this vital mechanism. On behalf
of the Caroline Institute, I extend to you our warm congratulations,
and ask you to receive the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine
from the hands of His Majesty the King.<sup>”(21)</sup>
<br>
To this day, Medawar’s observation has been abundantly confirmed. His work was the foundation for developing medicine to shut
down organ rejection among transplant patients. Otherwise, immunological memory would work against patients and attack foreign tissue
as if it was being infected from outside threats. Medawar’s observation
also put a spotlight on misguided vaccine supporters who insist that
vaccination is the only road to protection form childhood diseases.
<br>
Natural immunity works—but only if you support it with proper hygiene, sanitation, and what I call “nutrient logic.” Without
phagocytes, immunological memory, and the ability to identify self
from non-self, the power of natural immunity is diminished. This

		<p>forgotten logic dictates that today’s health and immunity threats are
simply the result of gaping nutrient deficiencies. By failing to give
your body the right nutrients, you deny the body its ability to grow,
build immunity, and protect itself.
<br>
Nutrient logic addresses the deficiency by filling the nutritional
void or malnutrition to restore proper cellular and immune function.
Better than a pharmacist doling out meds, the body becomes its own
“pharmacy” by producing custom-made medicine to enhance survival,
through nutrient logic.
<br>
The process is as simple and logical as resurrecting a dying, sundeprived plant with sun exposure and water, which initiates photosynthesis for the production of life-giving glucose. That same innate
intelligence guides our own health and immunity when we obtain
essential molecules—i.e., nutrients—from nature.
<br>
Just as hand washing and soap saved millions from infant mortality caused by unwanted intruders in a hospital setting, nutrient
logic boosts our natural defenses. Reams of scientific data show that
natural birth, breastfeeding, and cod liver oil (Norwegians’ mainstay
of health) are among the most important strategies for building and
protecting our children’s natural defenses.
<br>
Finding the proper cod liver oil can be challenging. This stems
from supplement hucksters who don’t know the difference between
naturally occurring nutrients and those made in a lab (synthetic) or
what I refer to here as “processed,” for simplification. Make the
wrong choice and you might be harming yourself with laboratory

The use of cod liver oil in medicine has been documented as far
back as Hippocrates and the Roman naturalist, Pliny. Safe and effective,
this oil was also used by the Vikings as early as the 700s to 1100.<br>

As cod liver oil continued its reign as a natural remedy through
harsh winters, Dr. Ruth A. Guy published <i>The History of Cod Liver Oil</i>
in 1923.(22) This was among the first and most extensive documents
showing positive, measurable results associated with using cod liver
oil, observed by physicians in <i>Germany</i>, Holland, England, and
France. Published in The American Journal of Diseases of Children,
Guy’s article documented numerous cod liver oil cures for:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Rickets</li>
<li>Rheumatism</li>
<li>Gout</li>
<li>Bone and joint diseases</li>
<li>Osteomalacia (softening of the bones)</li>
<li>Arrhythmia</li>
<li>Invasive blood clotting</li>
<li>Many forms of tuberculosis</li>
</ul>
<p>Back then, cod liver oil was unprocessed. If you’re going to consume cod liver oil today, then you’ll want to find a product that’s
been proven beneficial—unprocessed cod liver oil. Today you have
to look for “extra-virgin” cod liver oil.<br>

Fake cod liver oil knock-offs won’t yield healthy outcomes. In the
worst case scenario, they’ll harm your health, which is why I’d never
let my family choke them down. Regarding the side effects caused by
prescription omega-3 fats, the FDA published that, “adverse events

<h3>The Antibiotic Alternative</h3>
<p>As a father, by the time baby number four rolls around, you think
you have it all figured out. Your role, as a guy, is simply to stand on
the sidelines of birth and make sure mom and baby are comfortable
and safe. Then you wait for the big show.
<br>
I was as calm as a Buddhist monk sipping beer. We were preparing for another home birth. Been there, done that. We got this. But
then. . . . I got a frantic call from my wife. She’d just discovered she
had tested positive for Group B strep (GBS) while being pregnant.
Aubrey was due in four weeks.
<br>
Buddhist monk mode was over. GBS is a type of bacterial infection
that can be found in the uterus, placenta, or urinary tract. For many,
it’s harmless. But if transmitted to a baby during birth, the outcome is
a parent’s worst nightmare—shock, pneumonia, and/or meningitis.
<br>
Like 20-40% of pregnant moms, Lea-Ann was a carrier. As you can
imagine, she was distraught. After seven-and-a-half months of doing
everything right, suddenly now it seemed like something was terribly
wrong. Already in a vulnerable state, Lea-Ann’s head was spinning
with blame. “How could this have happened?” she wondered.
<br>
The possibility of a hospital birth and a sick baby was imminent.
I went into chemist mode. We began discussing the options, free of
the typical scare tactics from Western Medicine.
<br>
The typical protocol for GBS-positive moms is to pump the
mother full of IV antibiotics during birth, or perform a C-section.
Not on my watch.<br>
A healthy, natural childbirth sets the stage for a healthy future
and vice versa. This has been well established. Using antibiotics as
“preventive medicine” comes with life-long consequences. It wasn’t
worth the risk.

		<p> Fact is, bacteria is everywhere. Life is essentially water and bacteria. Test for any strain and you can usually find it. Therefore, being
afraid of bacteria isn’t a healthy life strategy . . . even if that bacteria
has a scary name like “GBS” or “Strep B”!
<br>
It’s extremely rare for a healthy mom to pass GBS onto a healthy
baby. Thanks to emergency medicine, it’s even more rare for a baby
to suffer the worst consequences of GBS. Plus, giving birth in water
(i.e., a water birth) adds yet another layer of protection, putting the
odds in your favor.
<br>
My wife and I both agreed to skip the antibiotics. After all, 50%
of the time, they don’t even work—and they yield side effects 100%
of the time. We got back on track for our home birth plan and
aimed for a healthy delivery in water.
<br>
I may know about antibiotics, but I have zero clinical experience with Strep B infection. So I arranged to have two superstar
midwives by our side to watch closely for signs of GBS upon
birth. Decades of wisdom and experience were lined up around
the tub!
<br>
In the last 50 years, Western Medicine has built a system of
blind loyalty to medications. When faced with the unknown—like
GBS—we throw medications at the patient like spaghetti on a wall
to see what sticks. The benefit is rarely greater than the risk.
<br>
In light of the superbug scourge (in which bacteria are now
learning to evade antibiotics), as well as the side effects to a baby’s
immune system, the general ineffectiveness of antibiotics, and the
wanton overuse of prescription drugs—we’re now in the grips of a
modern day tragedy. Ignoring these hard truths, hospitals are too
quick to slap IVs on mom and baby.

<p>Lea-Ann went into labor on Wednesday at 2 p.m. She went to
float in our swimming pool to ease the pain. I jumped in with Skyler
(who was by now a year old), and we both pondered if it would be
a girl or a boy.
<br>
I thought back to all the stages Lea-Ann and I had already been
through…parents of one kid, then two kids, then three kids, and
soon to be four. I remembered our first-born, Lily—who came out
of the womb so damn serious and driven, the home birth has paid
off in spades only 13 years later. Our second-born, Blair—benevolent, curious, and determined, instantly wrapped his long arms
around mom as he came out of the water. Our third-born, Skyler—
happy and playful day and night, so active you have to feed him on
the run.
<br>
All of our children have been resilient survivors and thrivers. All
of them were delivered in home births. Who’s next? I wondered.
After an hour of labor, it was time to wrap it up. Lea-Ann went
inside to sit in the tub. Shortly thereafter, her water broke. Seconds
later, she was holding our new baby girl. Gentle and appreciative,
our new daughter flailed her petite arms looking for something
familiar. Catching her attention, mom’s warm skin calmed her
instantly. She rested solemnly in mom’s arms. Eyes shut, the baby
savored the moment and held tight, all her senses coming to life.
She startled herself with a cry and quickly settled into mom’s loving
embrace. All was fine in the world.
<br>
We named her Aubrey.
<br>
In that one instant, everything changed. We were now the proud
parents of four! A carbon copy of Lea-Ann, Aubrey was born healthy,
happy, and full of love. Calm, centered, confident and borderline
sassy—she’s sure to keep Skyler in check throughout the years.

		<p> Antibiotics could have stolen this moment forever. Without
signs of infection or a dire need for them, antibiotics are the worst
possible meds to take. Using them as preventive medicine is totally
unnecessary, because you have no way knowing what strain of bacteria you’re even trying to prevent—and therefore have no idea
what medication to use, since all antibiotics target different strains.
<br>
In life-or-death situations, antibiotics are a luxury. But their
wanton overuse is slowly killing us. Not only are they inciting a
massive wave of side effects, they’re also training bacteria how to
evade our most potent medicines. The most common side effects of
antibiotics are:
		  </p>
		  
		  <ul>
		  <li>Dehydration</li>
<li>Liver and kidney failure</li>
<li>Nerve damage</li>
<li>Joint pain</li>
<li>Anxiety</li>
<li>Confusion</li>
<li>Agitation</li>
<li>Severe depression</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>If our current use of antibiotics continues at the rate it’s been
going, antibiotic resistance will soon yield all current medications
useless according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
<i>Scientific American</i> reported that many varieties of drug-resistant E.
coli have already been discovered in China. Even worse, the resistant super-bacteria is being spread by flies. As this threat of overusing man-made antibiotics increases, our defenses decrease. In time,
we could have no defenses left against biological nasties when we
truly need them in a life-threatening emergency. If this happens,</p>

<p>“our longevity would go back to the Stone Age, where every infection was life threatening,” warns the WHO.
<br>
Just by looking at the outcome of mass antibiotic use, we can see
that antibiotics should never be used as a first line of defense against
common illness. This means you must be committed to using natural immune boosters prior to rushing off for meds! When I wrote
<i>Over-The-Counter Natural Cures Expanded</i>, I taught that the lucky
run we’ve had with prescription antibiotics was over. While they
saved us short term, they’ll kill us longterm. Now we must rely on
our own immune system. To strengthen our natural defenses, we
can use natural medicine like andrographis (see <i>Over-the-Counter
Natural Cures Expanded</i>), which is proven to ward off biological nasties, safely and quickly, without risk. A long history of science has
proven its effectiveness against viral infection as well as the flu,
strep, and much more. In light of this, I stressed in the book that
antibiotics should never be used for:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Ear infection</li>
<li>Strep throat</li>
<li>Flu</li>
<li>Bee Stings</li>
<li>Common cold</li>
<li>Urinary tract infection</li>
<li>Preventive medicine during or after birth in hospital

				<p>If you must take any of these antibiotics, there are certain things
you can do to increase their safety profile: namely, consume them
with plenty of purified water, milk thistle, and probiotics, which
help rebuild the “good” bacteria in your gut that is destroyed by
antibiotics. Also, never consume alcohol while taking antibiotics, as
this will just increase the chances of suffering side effects.</p>

The euphoria over antibiotics can be strong, especially after
experiencing their amazing ability to rescue a loved one from the
grips of a truly life-threatening illness. But we can’t let the euphoria
overpower our logic and push us to overuse antibiotics. These meds
should always be the LAST line of defense, never the first.</p>

				<p>It’s similar to when a five-year-old covers up his eyes and yells,
“Nah nah nah! I can’t see you!” to his mother who’s sitting right in
front of him. That’s confirmation bias in its earliest form. The child
is ignoring that which is right in front of him—usually during a
scolding—courtesy of confirmation bias. Adults do the same thing
every day when it comes to their prescription meds. The patient
only “sees” the ridiculous benefits offered by a drug. They don’t see
the drug’s side effects, the checkbook science, or the fraud running
most of the drug industry.</p>
<p>
Public relations firms and marketing whizzes for Big Pharma bank
on confirmation bias, using it to create insane demands for meds.
They know they can leverage it to brainwash millions of people into
believing bullshit, despite the stench all around them (from the body
count of millions who died from using prescription drugs).</p>
<p>
Even some pilots have adhered to confirmation bias. When
weather didn’t cooperate for them, they refused to accept that it was
life-threatening to take off. They ignored the inclement weather
hovering above. “I can make it,” were the last words of pilots who
only saw what they wanted to see—courtesy of confirmation bias.</p>
<p>
During the “Dressgate” scandal, very few people saw that the
image of the dress was distorted and that technically, it didn’t have
just one color. It was a fake. There were multiple, computer-generated colors. Yet, subconsciously, people let their brain run amuck
and in their haste, they started choosing colors based on obscure
bits of information (OBOI). In reality, there should have been more
people saying “Who-Gives-a-Fuck?” and going back to living their
lives instead of wasting time arguing. When you don’t have all the
information available, you shouldn’t be making decisions about said
topic. You should be asking questions.</p>

				<p>Writing on the ambiguity of the dress, an article in the Times
stated that when people only have “obscure bits of information,”
their brain fills in the gaps and sees what it wants to see based on
how it is conditioned. This phenomenon has been tested and verified in many other fields. In the war of marketing and PR, OBOI is
used against you.</p>
<p>
Ever notice how Big Pharma and Western Medicine uses OBOI?
Think of the data you’re given. Ever feel like you weren’t being
given the whole picture from that television ad, social media post,
or parroted script from your “robo-doc?” “The benefits outweigh the
risks,” is a common refrain. But as you know by now, after reading
this book, that’s total bullshit.</p>
<p>
It’s conditioning people to take their meds. The media’s headlines are trying to sway your mind into accepting an invisible status
quo that says prescription drugs are good for you. This is done to
condition you via confirmation bias. Don’t fall for it.</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Big Pharma intentionally creates OBOI to fool the
American public from cradle to grave. Starting in school, they train
people to engage in an internal dialogue that says, “I need medication to be healthy.” By the time they’re adults, the technique has
already worked—and most people are trained to “follow doctor’s
orders” without question. This mantra gets seeped into the very
core of everyone’s consciousness.</p>
<p>
Like using only a few pixels on a computer screen to manipulate the color of a dress, Big Pharma uses just enough sound bites
(an expert here and a doctor there) to make drugs seem amazing.
Then they add in paid celebrities to endorse products they don't
have the slightest clue about. This massive business and public relations scam has been going on for ages.</p>

				<p>Like Nazi mind control, OBOI gets repeated thousands of times
per day on the news, in movies and in commercials, on social
media, on the radio, all while slowly gaining power over people’s
emotions and minds. The results are a slew of hypnotic messages
that echo sentiments of, “I need my meds.”</p>
<p>
Unless you’re keenly aware of this stuff, you’re probably not in
control of your life or your health. These useless, random bits of
info have successfully trained Americans to dutifully pop pills at a
doctor’s every whim. I overcame this scam only after spending years
with my head buried inside a library during college and graduate
school, and after rewiring my brain.</p>
<p>
Most people will defend their confirmation bias all the way to
the grave. I’ve seen it firsthand. Sadly, I’ve watched people die
young from meds before they’ve ever even considered an alternative
(or reading a fucking book).</p>
<p>
Before you know it, you’re taking blood pressure meds, Lipitor,
aspirin, and a fistful of other drugs to offset the side effects of the
original drugs you were taking. Never mind that this pharmaceutical
merry-go-round is killing thousands of Americans daily, and millions
worldwide. Like the pilot who fails to look at inclement weather, the
patient fails to look at the rising body count from prescription drugs.</p>
<p>
Good news is, you can stop the Nazi mind control crap right
now. You don’t have to be hypnotized by OBOI. You can simply arm
yourself with facts, and be ready to accept them whether your doctor likes them or not. Fortunately, when it comes to science, it only
takes one person to verify reproducible results, like an apple falling
from a tree. That, in a nutshell, is science. It doesn’t require a
democracy, a popularity contest, a Photoshopped celebrity, a ghostwritten article, or a staff meeting to see if everyone is on board. </p>

				<p>Want to free yourself from OBOI? Then ditch the meds (outside
of an emergency.) Medications are for sick people, not those living
young. You can’t be healthy and on meds at the same time. If you
go against this, then be prepared to face the consequences. You’ve
been warned!</p>
<p>
One individual dies about every five minutes from an
“approved” drug—that’s almost 300 deaths every day, according to
the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> (JAMA) and the
Institute of Medicine (IOM). The so-called cure is killing people.
Most people won’t win today’s prescription drug battle. If piled up,
the corpses from annual drug deaths would reach from Earth up
125,000 feet where Felix Baumgartner made his record-breaking
jump from space.</p>
<p>
Katrina is one of those rare people who escaped the scourge of
OBOI. After freeing herself, her life changed for the better.</p>
<p>
Like so many others, Katrina emailed me sharing how drugs had
ravaged her health. (She almost became a statistic—another nameless, faceless brick in the growing tower of pharmaceutical deaths.)
For 10 years, Katrina was a doctor's punching bag. Weighing in at
276 pounds, she was pummeled by this drug and that drug. When
those prescriptions didn’t work, the doctor increased the meds—
like a fighter throwing more uppercuts—while assuring Katrina “the
benefits outweighed the risks.”</p>
<p>
Sure, Katrina’s own bad habits had forced her into the medical
boxing ring. Over the phone, she admitted, “I was seriously sick and
had been for over a decade from self-inflicting abuse to my body.”</p>
<p>
It started when she was a kid.</p>
<p>
“I’ve been overweight since I was 8 years old. I ate mostly sugarcoated cereals, chips, and fast food. Of course the weight piled on.”

				<p>Our sick care system was set up to prey off of this exact scenario. Poisoned by the Standard American Diet (SAD) as kids, adult
lives are dominated by poor health. With OBOI dominating their
thought process, prescription medications are their first line of
defense.</p>
<p>
“I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in 2001 at the age of 30.
I’m 42 now and was on medicine since the age of 24. When I found
The People’s Chemist, I was on 9 prescription medicines including
the dreaded fat storing medication, insulin! My doctors had diagnosed me with high cholesterol, high triglycerides, high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes, morbid obesity, and hyperactive thyroid,”
Katrina wrote.</p>
<p>
Despite the barrage of prescription drugs she was taking (per
doctor's orders), her health continued to deteriorate. She spoke of
the ongoing emotional turmoil she suffered:</p>
<p>
“It was a daily struggle being overweight. Every minute was a
challenge.”</p>
<p>
“I didn’t know what to do.”</p>
<p>
Like a world champion heavyweight about to embark on an epic
comeback, Katrina did the only thing she could. She dug deep and
found a constellation of courage that gave her the strength to keep
fighting.</p>
<p>
“One night I was surfing the web for celebrity gossip and stumbled
across The People’s Chemist. I weighed 276 lbs at the time. The heaviest I had ever been. I read with intent and decided to ditch the meds.”</p>
<p>
Katrina started her comeback first by making the decision to
ditch the meds. When you have the toughness and power of a mom
who wants a better life for herself and daughter, nothing can hold
you back—especially when you’ve been taking rounds out of sheer</p>

<p>
Katrina was in smash mode. She used <i>Over-The-Counter Natural
Cures Expanded</i> to help her wean off the meds. Her transformation
began. She started applying the three pillars of health—detox,
nutrient logic, and hormone intelligence—to initiate her path
toward living young. Like resurrecting a dying plant, her body
began to heal itself. She also boosted her stamina!</p>
<p>
Within two months, Katrina was off insulin! With no more diabetes, the weight began to melt off thanks to her newly optimized
hormone balance, output, and sensitivity.</p>
<p>
Katrina was fighting for her life. Fighting focuses the mind and
heightens the senses. Lighter in weight, and with more room to
move, Katrina kept smashing. Her body began its natural detox
methods to remove metabolic, chemical, and environmental waste.
Nutrient logic restored her deficiencies. The three pillars of health
were slowly bringing her back from the dead.</p>
<p>
“Off my meds, my A1C levels dropped to 6.2. On meds it was
over 10. My triglycerides were 800, now 101! Numbers don’t lie,
like you say, it’s all about measurable results.”</p>
<p>
“I was off all my meds in only 7 months. I lost 100 pounds!”
“Shane, you gave me the information, tools, and products I
needed to change my life forever. I had my 1 yr anniversary last
Thursday and weighed in at 139.8 lbs! Total of 136.2 lbs lost—
down to size 6 pants and size medium shirt.”</p>
<p>
“I actually jump out of bed in the morning! I spend the weekends playing with my daughter. We go fishing, play at the park,
walk around the neighborhood, ride bikes, play basketball in the
driveway. Everything parents should be doing with their kids.”</p>

who has lost over 100 lbs before without having gastric bypass surgery.”</p>
<p>
“Oh, and I’ve never been able to shop for regular misses clothing. I’ve always been a plus size girl, even in middle and high
school. Lane Bryant was my shop of choice. I went in there a couple months ago to get a new pair of work pants and their smallest
size fell off of me. I literally didn’t know where to go to shop for
clothes! I had to ask some girlfriends where to get some regular size
clothes! It’s a whole new world.”</p>
<p>
Katrina's success story shows what's possible when you ditch
the meds and save yourself from doctor’s orders. There’s still hope
for those who’ve been afflicted with OBOI. You must start by looking around and making the simple observation that meds are the
problem, not the solution.</p>
<p>
No drug can do what Katrina did for herself: fight back against
a criminal status quo that’s been bullying and beating down patients
for decades in the name of health care.</p>
<p>
Now it’s your turn. Ditch the meds, fight back, and live young
using my three pillars of health:

				<p>And most importantly, I measure the active, medicinal ingredients in every batch. In other words, if it was an orange extract
being sold as a natural source of vitamin C, my testing would differentiate between ascorbic acid—often sold as “vitamin-C”—and
naturally occurring vitamin C. It also verifies the quantity. Nobody
else provides that deep level of quality verification. In total, my QC
tests guarantee that every product is natural, non-toxic and safe to
ingest.</p>

As part of my <i>Blue Diamond Series</i>, I’ve tested all of the recommended products in this book and included the QC test results free

<p>
Below, I’ve included a sample QC chart for Centrum
Multivitamin to “warm you up” for viewing the QC charts for each
product mentioned in 3 Worst Meds. You’ll notice that it fails my QC
standards, miserably.</p>
<p>
My QC test shows that Centrum Mulit-Vitamin for adults is
loaded with synthetic ingredients and doesn’t deliver a single nutrient from nature, as verified by natural HPLC standards. And while
it is still technically “United States Pharmacopeia (USP) grade” and
free of contamination, it’s still unhealthy. This single test proves how
today’s so-called quality standards are delivering false, synthetic
products to unassuming consumers. In comparison, the QC tests
for all the suggested products prove their natural origins and purity, thus ensuring safety and efficacy.</p>
